<H1>Name Server Software: NetWare, OS/2, VMS, and others</H1>


<H3>Novell Netware</H3>

<P>
Novell's NetWare IP 2.12 had a DNS subsystem including a name server.
It supported MX records and seemed to be fairly functional as a caching
server, but did not do zone transfers at that stage.  Version 2.2
apparently required the administrator to use a menu system for
configuration.  More details of the DNS subsystem for NetWare would
be welcome.
</P>


<H3>OS/2</H3>

<P>
Ports of old versions of BIND to OS/2 exist, although I'm not
aware of any more recent than BIND 8.2.4.
Several of these can be found at the
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&dir=/pub/os2/util/network/tcpip">hobbes</A>
archive.
</P>

<P>
IBM apparently also provided a name server for OS/2.  Further details
would be welcome.
</P>

<P>
IBM had a name server implementation in their TCP/IP for VM and MVS.
Craig Jackson mentioned that the name server in the mainframe TCP/IP
product is not based on BIND but on software developed in the mid-80's
at the University of Wisconsin, and uses a relational database backend.
It is not known if these products are still available.
</P>


<H3>VMS</H3>

<P>
TGV Multinet included an enhanced VMS port of BIND.  Craig Jackson
mentioned that the TGV port (as of 1996) ran under TGV's superserver
and was heavily multithreaded.  This software is now under the banner of
Process Software.  Jeff Schreiber from Process Software stated that their
TCPware DNS server was a VMS port of BIND, with added features such as
cluster load balancing.  According to Dave Barlow from Process Software,
The code base for MultiNet V4.1 is BIND 4.9.7 while later versions are
based on BIND 8.

<P>
Paul Vixie mentioned that DEC's VMS TCP/IP implementation had a name
server not based on BIND.
</P>

<P>
Brad Knowles reported using Wollongong TCP-IP under VAX/VMS; apparently
the work was originally done by TGV and was based on BIND.
</P>


<H3>MS-DOS and related systems</H3>

<P>
The KA9Q suite of DOS communications software contains a DNS server.

<P>
Steve D. Miller pointed out that the NetManage ChameleonNFS 4.0 manual
stated that the product included a DNS server.  It seems it only did
hostname to IP translation.  Later versions of NFS/X were released, but no
details about the functionality of the included name server are available.
</P>

<P>
A package called "bind" was available from FTP Software under MS-DOS.
This was discontinued several years ago.
</P>


<H3>Banyan VINES</H3>

<P>
Banyan shipped a DNS server.  According to Merton Campbell Crockett,
FTP Software provided the original TCP/IP support for Banyan VINES.
</P>


<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>

<P>
Roland Schemers implemented <A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~schemers/docs/lbnamed/lbnamed.html">lbnamed</A>,
a load-balancing DNS forwarder, at Stanford and presented a <A
HREF="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa95/schemers.html">paper</A>
on it at the LISA IX conference in September 1995.
<CODE>lbnamed</CODE> is implemented as a Perl script, and strictly
speaking is not a server but a server adjunct.
</P>

<P>
This idea is now widely used by vendors of commercial load balancing
appliances and other network hardware, though in contrast to
<CODE>lbnamed</CODE>, some black-box trickery is involved and source
code is generally not available.
</P>

<P>
The Perl module <A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/Stanford-DNSserver/">Stanford::DNSserver</A>
is a recent further development of <CODE>lbnamed</CODE>, by Rob Riepel
and several contributors.
</P>


<P>
Simon Leinen came up with a real exotic:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    The DNS server in Genera, the operating system of the Symbolics
    Lisp Machines.  It is written in Lisp (of course).  The source is
    about 750 lines long.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
   

<P>
Richard Shuford sent information on the md-dns name server which ran
on VOS for Stratus fault-tolerant computers, but appears to have been
discontinued.
