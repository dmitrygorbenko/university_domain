<H1>Name Server Software: Unix
</H1>


<H3>BIND</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">BIND</A> is the reference
implementation of a DNS server and usually serves as the base for
experimentation with DNS protocol extensions.  BIND is free and has
been ported to many operating systems; see the respective entries
in the <A HREF="./#index">index</A>.  Most BIND servers run on some
variant of Unix, although <A HREF="windows.html">BIND on Windows</A>
is also available.
</P>

<P>
BIND is the proverbial kitchen sink of DNS.  This has led to
familiar problems associated with legacy software: a large code
base, increasing feature bloat, and severe security problems during
2001 and 2002 (although no serious security issues were reported
in 2003 or 2004).  Some of the main issues are covered in an
<A HREF="http://www.circleid.com/article/774_0_1_0_C/">article by
Paul Vixie</A>.
</P>

<P>
Because of its long development history and its support for most of
the <A HREF=../rfc/">DNS standards</A>, BIND is generally preferred
for large production name servers on the Internet.  At the other end
of the scale, BIND can also run well on an ancient PC with as little
as 32MB RAM, and this can be a low-cost name server platform for a
smaller site on a budget.
</P>

<P>
At the time of writing, the most recent release of BIND is <A
HREF="http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind9.php">BIND 9.2.4</A>, released
in September 2004.  This contains bug fixes and also allows top level
domain wildcard records to be ignored (for instance, Network Solutions'
.COM redirection).  BIND 9.3.0 is also out, with some experimental
DNSSEC features.
</P>

<P>
BIND 9 is the reference implementation, but some large sites are
still running <A HREF="http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind8.php">BIND 8</A>
(the latest released version is 8.4.5),
since it has less strict syntax checking, runs
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/briefs/lp2kr_dns_server_results.txt">faster</A>
for certain applications, and (ahem) supports some "legacy
practices" that do not technically conform to the published
<A HREF="../rfc/">standards</A>.  BIND 9 is a better bet.
</P>


<H3>djbdns</H3>

<P>
D. J. Bernstein's <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</A>
is a widely used collection of DNS tools from the author of the
<A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail mail server</A>.  The two
main name server functions of caching and acting as an authoritative
server are sensibly split into two separate programs
(<A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html">dnscache</A>
and <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html">tinydns</A>).
The djbdns package is free
<A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html">(with some
minor restrictions on distribution of modified versions)</A>,
and comes with a <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/guarantee.html">$500
security guarantee</A>.  Worth a look.
</P>


<H3>ANS/CNS</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.nominum.com/products_technology.php?id=85">ANS/CNS</A>
are commercial DNS servers from
<A HREF="http://www.nominum.com">Nominum</A>, for enterprise
applications that need maximum performance.  For those with serious
budgets.


<H3>PowerDNS</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.powerdns.com/">pdns</A> is in reasonably wide use,
including at some large infrastructure providers.  The software is
covered by the GPL, while support is offered on a contract basis.
Worth a look.
</P>


<H3>NSD</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/nsd/">NSD</A> is a recently developed
open source server, used at several large registries.  Worth a look.
</P>


<H3>MaraDNS</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.maradns.org/">MaraDNS</A> is relatively new, free,
and written to be secure against remote compromise.  Worth a look.
</P>


<H3>Dents</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dents/">Dents</A> is a name
server implementation for Unix covered by the GPL.  The code has
been stuck in testing for years, and is probably not appropriate for
production use.
