<H1>Name Server Software: MacOS
</H1>


<H3>MacOS 9 and earlier</H3>

<P>
MacOS 9 and earlier versions were not designed for servers.  Despite this
MacOS often forms the basis for low to medium range servers when ease
of administration is more important than that last 0.1% of uptime.
There is at least one robust DNS server for MacOS.

<P>
QuickDNS from Men and Mice is a commercial fully functional DNS server,
including a slick GUI configuration frontend.
High performance is a feature that is stressed by the vendor.
This product is currently the main choice for sites that wish to use
MacOS as the platform for DNS.

MacDNS is a free Apple product, now somewhat dated.
I have not tested it fully, but it
appears to satisfactorily support inward and outward transfers, has an
`Apple interface', and supports stub resolvers by forwarding recursive
queries to a designated recursive name server in the manner of a slave
forwarder.  There may be interoperability problems with
post-8.0 versions of MacOS.

NonSequitur (formerly MIND) is a rather dated free implementation of a
DNS server for MacOS.  It does not support inward transfers or recursion,
so its use is probably limited to sites where all resolvers are capable
of recursion (this is true for MacOS), or as a hidden master server.

Pictorius Net Servers is a set of network servers including a DNS
server, bundled into a single free application.  The vendor, Pictorius
Inc, appears to be focusing on selling add-ons to the servers.

Carl Steadman is co-author of the book `Providing Internet Services via
the Mac OS' which is available on line.  It includes a well-written
though rapidly aging section on MacOS DNS servers, including a step by
step introduction.

<H3>MacOS X</H3>

<P>
MacOS X is expected to have a large range of DNS server options, based
on its Unix roots.  Details would be welcome.
