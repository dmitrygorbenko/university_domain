HREF="http://www.menandmice.com/infobase/mennmys/vefsidur.nsf/index/2.1">DNS Expert v1.3</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 11-Feb-1999</EM></H4>

DNS Expert comes from Men&amp;Mice of Iceland, who's goal is to produce
the only DNS checking tool a DNS administrator will ever need.  They
are not there yet - but I would go as far as to say that DNS Expert is
already by far the best tool of its kind available on ANY platform.
At $295, it's not cheap - but busy administrators will find that it pays
for itself in the first few days.

<P>
DNS Expert works only with "live" DNS data - nslint-style pre-checking
of zones is not possible.  The power comes from the ability to customise
analysis for checking nearly 70 DNS problems,  ranging from "more
than one A record with the same IP address" to "same mail server listed
with a different preference value".

<P>
<IMG SRC="dnsexp.gif" ALT="DNS Expert - Analysis Settings" BORDER=1 height=361 width=359>

<P>
The miscellaneous checks include reporting on experimental, obsolete,
&amp; unknown RRs.  There are some omissions: useful ones like sanity
checking on the hostmaster info in the SOA record, and obscure ones such
as checking to ensure that RP records point to TXT records.  (However,
I happen to like RP records!)

<P>
Checking itself proceeds very quickly.  There's no option to specify
recursive checking, but this problem can be sidestepped by providing DNS
Expert with a list of zones to be checked.  Whilst DNS Expert usefully
understands the difference between Internet &amp; Intranet DNS, it does
not seem to be able to analysis both types in a single checking operation.

<P>
Another strength of DNS Expert is in reporting, which can be done to
screen/printer/file with a choice of three levels of detail.
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="bad-dns.gif" ALT="DNS Expert v1.3 Report" height=572 width=509>

<P>
The detailed report type comes with a lot of explanatory information
that is of great use in troubleshooting.

<P>
DNS Expert would benefit from the addition of a scheduler or support
for execution with command line parameters, thereby allowing checking
to be carried via a cron job.  I would also like to see support for
emailing of reports.  With such features missing, I cannot yet retire
my <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~barr/dnswalk/">dnswalk</A>
but even so, DNS Expert is already providing far more information than
anything I currently use on Unix (and it hurts a bit to say that).

HREF="http://www.cyberkit.net/">Cyberkit v2.2</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 03-Jun-1998</EM></H4>

A very useful utility for users of Windows 95. Cyberkit v2.2 include Ping,
TraceRoute, Finger, WhoIs, Name Server LookUp, Quote of the Day, Check
for New Mail and Keep Alive.  Every individual tool works well.  Cyberkit
v2.2's main attraction is its great value (postcardware) and the 16 query
types available in the Lookup module:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Winsock Function GetHostByX
<BR>A - Host address
<BR>ALL - All records
<BR>CNAME - Canonical name for an alias
<BR>HINFO - Host information
<BR>MAILB - Mailbox related records
<BR>MB - Mailbox domain name
<BR>MG - Mail group member
<BR>MINFO - Mailbox or mail list information
<BR>MR - Mail rename domain name
<BR>MX - Mail exchange
<BR>NS - Authoritative name server
<BR>PTR - Domain name pointer
<BR>SOA - Start of a zone of authority
<BR>TXT - Text strings
<BR>WKS - Well known service description</BLOCKQUOTE>

HREF="http://www.cyberkit.net/">Cyberkit v2.4</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 17-Dec-1998</EM></H4>

A great utility just gets better and better.  Cyberkit v2.3 &amp; higher
use Winsock 2 and add features such as DBScanner and Time Synchronization
modules to the tools found in Cyberkit v2.2.

<P>
The Ping and Traceroute functions have been improved and the Lookup
module now supports AXFR (zone transfer) and RP (Responsible Person)
queries - the latter making the TXT query rather more useful than it
was in Cyberkit v2.2. It can be noted that all Cyberkit output is now
shown in Rich text, thereby breaking the 30,000 character limit that
constrains many competing tools.  Perform a Zone Transfer of your ISP's
domain and you'll likely discover why this is important...

<P>
The time client is rather basic, supporting Time, Daytime, &amp; SNTP
protocols.  What makes this module extremely useful is the complete ntp
packet decode - everything from Leap Indicator to Reference ID, and all
shown in an understandable form.

<P>
Probably the most important new features introduced since Cyberkit v2.2
are the command-line parameters.  Almost every Cyberkit feature can be
kicked off in this way.  This makes Cyberkit perfect for integration
into network monitoring packages such as Whats Up Gold or CA Unicentre.
Right-click on a router icon and perform a PTR Lookup query; right-click
on your DNS server icon and check that it iscorrectly time-synchronised.

<P>
All this and Cyberkit is still postcardware!

NAME="DNS Workshop"
HREF="http://www.evolve.co.uk/dns/">DNS Workshop Build 104</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 30-Oct-1997. Updated: 08-Jun-1998</EM></H4>

This tool operates on Windows 95 &amp; on Windows NT. It performs only
A and PTR DNS queries, and cannot query any but the DNS server configured
in your TCP/IP config.  The simple DNS lookup allows use of wildcards to
query a range of IP addresses in a single operation, within the limit of
a C-class address.  Unfortunately, the results of a wildcard search are not
sorted.

<P>
The strength of DNSWS lies in its ability to process files such as webserver
logs, replacing IP addresses by host or WINS names.  Query responses are
cached, but only for the course of the session.  Even so, the caching can
be very useful.  In tests, DNSWS processed a 12 Mb firewall log file in
5 hours.  Immediately processing a duplicate file cut the time to 10 minutes.

<P>
The lack of a configurable time-out is a drawback.  Processing can be
very fast indeed when all addresses are resolvable, but slows to a crawl
when many addresses have neither a PTR nor WINS record.  There are no command
line parameters which would allow log processing to be automated.  Corrupt
WINS responses can cause problems (such as consumption of 100% of CPU)
but no crashes occur.

<P>
DNSWS is rather expensive at 24.95 Pounds Sterling, but is almost unique
in its ability to process files.  It has potential and should be considered
a utility to keep an eye on.

NAME="NetInfo"
HREF="http://www.netinfo.co.il/">NetInfo v3.0 (Build 1208)</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 17-Dec-1998</EM></H4>

Freeware Internet utility that seems to have replaced the PingPlus utility
written by the same author.  Has Ping, Traceroute, &amp; Simple NSLookup
(A &amp; PTR queries), and Local Host Info.  NetInfo also has the ability
to scan a range of IP addresses for the presence of hosts and a service
scanner which will detect DNS, HTTP, etc on a particular host. v3.0 introduces
a system tray utility for monitoring the up/down status of IP connected
computers.

<P>
NetInfo uses Tree and List controls for its output, using an Explorer-style
tree format that can be "exploded". This is attractive but does not offer
the ability to cut &amp; paste results.  However, support has now been added
for printing.

<P>
<IMG SRC="netinfo.gif" ALT="NetInfo v2.10 Traceroute Output" HSPACE=1 VSPACE=1 BORDER=1 height=261 width=356>

<P>
The scanner can examine a single C Class address range at a time. v2.x
added the ability to scan a portion of a C Class address.  However, the
scan module is single-threaded and therefore rather slow.  The mechanism
for entering the "seed" scan address was originally badly conceived and
very buggy...it was much too easy to enter a bogus address which thoroughly
confuses NetInfo.  Things do now seem to be fixed with v3.0.

<P>
The service scanner was greatly improved in v2.x.  It now strobes a range
of ports and the list of ports that are scanned can be customised.  Twelve
well-known services are scanned by default.  The scanner is not suitable
for scanning all ports in a given range - unless you want to spend a few
hours on customising. v2.1 adds the ability to specify whether TCP or UDP
should be checked...a feature that is not found in many other utilities.

<P>
The "IPMonitor" Tool uses simple ping and seems quite functional.  However,
the ability to edit the list of monitored hosts extends only to scan interval,
timeout, and number of retries - one cannot edit the hostname/IP address
without deleting the entry and then recreating it.

<P>
NetInfo compares badly with utilities such as WS_Ping ProPack - but
it is free.

NAME="Ping Plotter"
HREF="http://www.nessoft.com/pingplotter/">Ping Plotter v1.00.2</A></H3>

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 16-Jun-1998</EM></H4>

A very interesting freeware Trace Route utility that displays the response
time along the route in an easy-to-read graph.  Individual hops are coloured
green (normal), yellow (warning), or red (critical), depending on the response
time - and the "time-width" of each band can be customised.  Ping Plotter
can perform a trace any number of times, with a configurable trace delay
of between 1 second and 1 hour - or longer, if you want.  The graph itself
is drawn based on the average of the most recent 10 samples (configurable)
and also displays the range of response times for each hop.  All of this
adds together to make a utility that is very useful for getting an idea
of the performance of a single link over a period of time.

<P>
<IMG SRC="pingplot.gif" ALT="Ping Plotter Output" height=389 width=616>

<P>
Additionally, Ping Plotter uses multiple threads so all points in the
sample are gathered at the same time.  This works very well - the speed
of DNS name resolution for multiple hops in a trace is particularly impressive.

<P>
There are only a couple of small drawbacks in Ping Plotter v
<UL>
<LI>
The graph does not display information such as time-stamps (to indicate
the period over which the trace(s) were conducted) or the number of Trace
Routes included.</LI>

<LI>
There is no other way of exporting the graph other than by using a copy
to clipboard function.  It's easy to pop this output into "Paint" and then
save in bitmap format, but it would be nice to be able to save in gif format
straight from Ping Plotter.</LI>
</UL>
However, both of these shortfalls are addressed in the shareware version
of Ping Plotter, v2.03, that I hope to review shortly.

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 25-Oct-1997. Updated: 8-Jun-1998</EM></H4>

A freeware multi-threaded console ping utility for Win 95 and NT. Can give
a simple go/no-go response that is suitable for checking if a remote machine
is responding.  It's strength lies in its abiity to accept multiple remote
machine names as well as 'wild-cards' for IP addresses.  A verbose option
additionally performs a reverse DNS/WINS lookup and gives packet Round
Trip Time.  In tests on a local subnet, 254 hosts were scanned in 3.5 seconds.
Using the verbose option the same test took some 50 seconds, being slowed
down only by time-outs on unresolvable addresses.  A useful complement to
one's toolkit...no matter that it is now three years old.

Rating: 8/10.

<H4><EM>Reviewed: 06-Jan-1998. Updated 18-Dec-1998</EM></H4>

Ping/Lookup/Traceroute utilities for Win 95/NT. Multithreaded and very
fast.  Ping &amp; Traceroute is slightly more configurable than in most
other similar utilities.  One nice feature (shared by both versions) is
the ability to customise the packet data that is sent.. Thus, the user
can insert an email address in each packet as a form of netiquette.  The
Ping function allows one to show the returned data....another reason to
have data that is in a readable form.  The only minor gripe is that parameters
can only be changed by switching to another screen.

<P>
The lookup functionality is very basic, supporting only A record queries.
However, this does fit in with the overall aim of these two utilities.

<P>
All output is in Rich Text Format, which looks great.  All output can
be logged to a user-specified file.  Right mouse button functionality is
supported for all windows.

<P>
The Pro version has a useful host manager that allows the user to give
a Profile Name to each IP address/DNS name.  Double-clicking on a Profile
Name pings the corresponding address.  Items in the host manager can be
sorted by Profile Name or by IP address/DNS Name.  The host manager makes
a pleasant change from the usual drop down list of addresses - lists that
often end up with duplicate or blank entries.

<P>
Additionally, the Pro version has an ISPinger feature that keeps your
Internet Service Provider connection from being disconnected due to inactivity.
TJPingPro can run in the System Tray under Win 95/NT 4.0.

<P>
TJPing Pro v1.1 adds an on-line registration capability and scanners
that can ping either a sequence of IP addresses or a user-defined list
of addresses.  With v1.2.1 comes the ability to add sequence scan groups,
and perform DNS lookups for scans.  However, the scans are much slower than
WS_Ping's.

<P>
TJPing is freeware and TJPing Pro is shareware, costing $US 12.50.

<P>
Both rate 8/10.

There are several other excellent utilities that I use on a daily basis
and for which I have not yet written reviews.  However, I can still give
some preliminary ratings:
