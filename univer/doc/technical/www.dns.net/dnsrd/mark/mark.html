Umm...and that's me</H1>
My name is Mark Symons.  I was born in Pembury in Kent, UK, and have no
idea whether that makes me a "Kentish Man" or a "Man of Kent". Being the
son of a British Army Officer I have lived in several countries (including
Germany, Turkey, and Cyprus).

<P>
I managed to get myself a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University
of Leeds in the UK and went to South Africa in 1985, having first worked
for a while on an archaeological excavation at the Roman Fort in Castleford,
West Yorkshire.  I would love to hear from anyone who can tell me what has
happened at that site since then.

<P>
After working as a Process Engineer on AECI's Chlorine Plant in Sasolburg
for four years, I drifted into the world of computing...and have stayed
there ever since.  I joined AECI Information Services in 1992 (and was sysop
of AECI BBS). AIS became part of EDS Africa Ltd in 1995, and I worked
happily at EDS until the end of March 1999.

<P>
Over the last few years I have become overly fond of taking other people's
lovingly crafted software and seeing if I can make it squeak in agony.
Which explains the <A HREF="wintools.html">reviews</A>. This is a
hobby that has led to my recent move to the USA, where I am now working
in Software Testing for <A HREF="http://www.ipswitch.com">Ipswitch, Inc</A>.
Therefore, I will not be writing further software reviews for DNSRD - it
would not be appropriate.

<P>
I am passionate about history, blues music, science fiction, comics,
and two fat, grey kitty-cats called "Kouros" and "Loki". I'm currently
taking a <A HREF="http://www.unisa.ac.za/dept/class/courses/ahs/index.html">course
in Ancient History</A> at UNISA, the University of South Africa.
At the other end of the history spectrum, I'm also an occasional contributor
to <A HREF="http://uboat.net/">uboat.net,</A> the definitive website
related to the U-Boat war 1939-45.
