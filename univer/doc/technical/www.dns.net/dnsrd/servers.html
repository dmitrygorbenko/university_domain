<H1>DNS server software</H1>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">

<P>
This survey of DNS servers is organized into sections for each major
type of operating system for which DNS server software is available.
In addition to servers listed in this document, there are some
large-scale IP address management systems available which include a
DNS server as a component of the system; these are covered in the <A
HREF="/dnsrd/tools.html">Tools section</A>.
</P>

<P>
Functional DNS servers are available for Unix (including Linux, FreeBSD
and MacOS X), Windows XP/2000/NT/98/95, MacOS, VMS, and OS/2 (see my
<A HREF="#serverdef">definitions</A>).  The standard implementation
of a DNS server is BIND on Unix, although BIND has also been ported
to other platforms.  Some of the other options discussed here may
also be viable, but an operating system designed for robust servers
is likely to be a more stable platform for a name server than an
operating system designed for the desktop.

<H2>Software Index</H2>

<P>
The reference DNS server software is
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">BIND</A>.
Most production Internet name servers are based on BIND running on
some form of Unix (including Linux and MacOS X).  Microsoft's DNS
server for Windows XP/2000/NT is popular in Microsoft environments.
Other significant options are the various ports of BIND to Windows,
and several non-BIND servers for Unix, MacOS and VMS.

<H2><A NAME="serverdef">About Internet name servers</A></H2>

<P>
For a name server to be usable on the Internet, it must support either
zone transfers from other servers, or other servers transferring zones
from it.  If neither inward nor outward transfers are supported, there
is no way to link the server into the global DNS hierarchy, and it can
only be used for caching, to provide an enhanced service to local name
server clients (called <EM>resolvers</EM>).
</P>

<P>
A server will usually need to support recursive queries from stub
resolvers, which are the most common types of DNS client software.
In addition, a useful server must support at least the common resource
record types A, MX, PTR, SOA, CNAME, NS.  For general use, a name
server should support caching.
</P>

<P>
This is realy a minimal list of absolutely required features; modern
DNS servers should ideally support DNS features beyond these, such
as dynamic update, incremental zone transfers, DNSSEC, IPv6 operation
and more.
</P>

<P>
By these minimal criteria, there are currently functional name servers
available for Unix (including Linux), Windows (NT, 2000, XP and 95/98),
MacOS and MacOS X, VMS, and OS/2.
The current standard implementation of a DNS server is BIND on Unix
(including Linux and MacOS X), although BIND has also been ported to
VMS, Windows, and OS/2.  Some of the other platforms discussed here
may also be viable, but bear in mind that an operating system designed
for robust servers is likely to prove a more stable platform for a
name server than an operating system designed for the desktop.

<H2>Background on name servers</H2>

<P>
The DNS database is partitioned into sets of related records that are
replicated on multiple servers; each such set of records is called a
<EM>zone</EM>.  Name servers transfer zones from each other to maintain
the consistency of information in the DNS.
</P>

<P>
Zone transfers from other servers are `inward transfers', and a server
performing inward transfers is referred to as a <EM>slave server</EM>
for these zones.  Zone transfers to other servers are `outward
transfers'.  It is quite common for a server to perform both inward
transfers and outward transfers for the same zone.  The unique server
which performs only outward transfers and no inward transfers for a
specific zone, is known as the <EM>master server</EM> for that zone.
The master server for a zone is where changes to the DNS records need
to be made.  Changes made to a zone on a slave server for that zone,
will be overwritten during the next inward transfer.
</P>

<P>
Most name servers are master for some zones and slave for other zones.
A server is <EM>authoritative</EM> for the zones that it is either a
master or a slave for.  A typical name server can be authoritative for
hundreds of zones, and large servers are authoritative for millions
of zones.
</P>

<P>
A server will usually need to support recursive queries from stub
resolvers, which are the most common types of DNS client software
(a <EM>stub resolver</EM> hands off recursive queries to a server to
resolve, instead of performing the full iterative resolution process
itself).  Some servers are configured to forward most queries on to
another name server, much like a stub resolver does.  Name servers
on a network protected by a firewall typically forward queries to a
name server running on the firewall.

<H2>About this document</H2>

<P>
This survey of name server software for the Domain Name System
(DNS) was started in 1995.  It was originally posted to USENET as
the Exotic Name Servers document, and later became the Name Server
Software Summary.  Since these are my personal views on the topic,
some information is likely to be missing or flawed.  Comments and
suggestions are always welcome.
