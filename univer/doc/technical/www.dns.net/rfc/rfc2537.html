<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated distributed
database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and other information.
The DNS has been extended to include digital signatures and cryptographic
keys as described in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].&nbsp; Thus
the DNS can now be secured and used for secure key distribution.
<p>This document describes how to store RSA keys and and RSA/MD5 based
signatures in the DNS.&nbsp; Familiarity with the RSA algorithm is assumed
[Schneier].&nbsp; Implementation of the RSA algorithm in DNS is recommended.
<p>The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC
2119</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. RSA Public KEY Resource Records</h2>
RSA public keys are stored in the DNS as KEY RRs using algorithm number
1 [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].&nbsp; The structure of the algorithm
specific portion of the RDATA part of such RRs is as shown below.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Size</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exponent length&nbsp;&nbsp;
1 or 3 octets (see text)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exponent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as specified by length field</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modulus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
remaining space</tt>
<p>For interoperability, the exponent and modulus are each currently limited
to 4096 bits in length.&nbsp; The public key exponent is a variable length
unsigned integer.&nbsp; Its length in octets is represented as one octet
if it is in the range of 1 to 255 and by a zero octet followed by a two
octet unsigned length if it is longer than 255 bytes.&nbsp; The public
key modulus field is a multiprecision unsigned integer.&nbsp; The length
of the modulus can be determined from the RDLENGTH and the preceding RDATA
fields including the exponent. Leading zero octets are prohibited in the
exponent and modulus.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. RSA/MD5 SIG Resource Records</h2>
The signature portion of the SIG RR RDATA area, when using the RSA/MD5
algorithm, is calculated as shown below.&nbsp; The data signed is determined
as specified in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].&nbsp; See [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC
2535</a>] for fields in the SIG RR RDATA which precede the signature itself.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; hash = MD5 ( data )
<p>&nbsp; signature = ( 00 | 01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash ) ** e (mod
n)
<p>where MD5 is the message digest algorithm documented in [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1321.txt">RFC
1321</a>], "|" is concatenation, "e" is the private key exponent of the
signer, and "n" is the modulus of the signer's public key.&nbsp; 01, FF,
and 00 are fixed octets of the corresponding hexadecimal value. "prefix"
is the ASN.1 BER MD5 algorithm designator prefix specified in [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2437.txt">RFC
2437</a>], that is,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; hex 3020300c06082a864886f70d020505000410 [NETSEC].
<p>This prefix is included to make it easier to use RSAREF (or similar
packages such as EuroRef).&nbsp; The FF octet MUST be repeated the maximum
number of times such that the value of the quantity being exponentiated
is the same length in octets as the value of n.
<p>(The above specifications are identical to the corresponding part of
Public Key Cryptographic Standard #1 [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2437.txt">RFC
2437</a>].)
<p>The size of n, including most and least significant bits (which will
be 1) MUST be not less than 512 bits and not more than 4096 bits.&nbsp;
n and e SHOULD be chosen such that the public exponent is small.
<p>Leading zero bytes are permitted in the RSA/MD5 algorithm signature.
<p>A public exponent of 3 minimizes the effort needed to verify a signature.&nbsp;
Use of 3 as the public exponent is weak for confidentiality uses since,
if the same data can be collected encrypted under three different keys
with an exponent of 3 then, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem [NETSEC],
the original plain text can be easily recovered.&nbsp; This weakness is
not significant for DNS security because we seek only authentication, not
confidentiality.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Performance Considerations</h2>
General signature generation speeds are roughly the same for RSA and DSA
[<a href="rfc2536.html">RFC 2536</a>].&nbsp; With sufficient pre-computation,
signature generation with DSA is faster than RSA.&nbsp; Key generation
is also faster for DSA.&nbsp; However, signature verification is an order
of magnitude slower with DSA when the RSA public exponent is chosen to
be small as is recommended for KEY RRs used in domain name system (DNS)
data authentication.
<p>Current DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers, typically
less than 512 bytes including overhead.&nbsp; While larger transfers will
perform correctly and work is underway to make larger transfers more efficient,
it is still advisable at this time to make reasonable efforts to minimize
the size of KEY RR sets stored within the DNS consistent with adequate
security.&nbsp; Keep in mind that in a secure zone, at least one authenticating
SIG RR will also be returned.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Security Considerations</h2>
Many of the general security consideration in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC
2535</a>] apply.&nbsp; Keys retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted
unless (1) they have been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently
verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure obtainment
or independent verification conform to security policies acceptable to
the user.&nbsp; As with all cryptographic algorithms, evaluating the necessary
strength of the key is essential and dependent on local policy.
<p>For interoperability, the RSA key size is limited to 4096 bits.&nbsp;
For particularly critical applications, implementors are encouraged to
consider the range of available algorithms and key sizes.
