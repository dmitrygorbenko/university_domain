<h1>
Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)</h1></center>

<h2>
Status of this Memo</h2>
This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the Internet
community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.&nbsp;
Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol
Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol.&nbsp;
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Abstract</h2>
The Domain Name System was originally designed to support queries of a
statically configured database.&nbsp; While the data was expected to change,
the frequency of those changes was expected to be fairly low, and all updates
were made as external edits to a zone's Master File.
<p>Using this specification of the UPDATE opcode, it is possible to add
or delete RRs or RRsets from a specified zone.&nbsp; Prerequisites are
specified separately from update operations, and can specify a dependency
upon either the previous existence or nonexistence of an RRset, or the
existence of a single RR.
<p>UPDATE is atomic, i.e., all prerequisites must be satisfied or else
no update operations will take place.&nbsp; There are no data dependent
error conditions defined after the prerequisites have been met.

<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1 - Definitions</h2>
This document intentionally gives more definition to the roles of "Master,"
"Slave," and "Primary Master" servers, and their enumeration in NS RRs,
and the SOA MNAME field.&nbsp; In that sense, the following server type
definitions can be considered an addendum to [RFC1035], and are intended
to be consistent with [RFC1996]:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Slave</td>

<td>an authoritative server that uses AXFR or IXFR to&nbsp; retrieve the
zone and is named in the zone's NS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RRset.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Master</td>

<td>an authoritative server configured to be the source of AXFR or IXFR
data for one or more slave&nbsp; servers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Primary Master</td>

<td>master server at the root of the AXFR/IXFR dependency graph.&nbsp;
The primary master is named in the zone's SOA MNAME field and optionally
by an NS RR.&nbsp; There is by definition only one primary master server
per zone.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A domain name identifies a node within the domain name space tree structure.&nbsp;
Each node has a set (possibly empty) of Resource Records (RRs).&nbsp; All
RRs having the same NAME, CLASS and TYPE are called a Resource Record Set
(RRset).
<p>The pseudocode used in this document is for example purposes only. If
it is found to disagree with the text, the text shall be considered authoritative.&nbsp;
If the text is found to be ambiguous, the pseudocode can be used to help
resolve the ambiguity.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="1.1"></a>1.1 - Comparison Rules</h3>
<a NAME="1.1.1"></a>1.1.1. Two RRs are considered equal if their NAME,
CLASS, TYPE, RDLENGTH and RDATA fields are equal.&nbsp; Note that the time-to-live
(TTL) field is explicitly excluded from the comparison.
<p><a NAME="1.1.2"></a>1.1.2. The rules for comparison of character strings
in names are specified in [RFC1035 2.3.3].
<p><a NAME="1.1.3"></a>1.1.3. Wildcarding is disabled.&nbsp; That is, a
wildcard ("*") in an update only matches a wildcard ("*") in the zone,
and vice versa.
<p><a NAME="1.1.4"></a>1.1.4. Aliasing is disabled: A CNAME in the zone
matches a CNAME in the update, and will not otherwise be followed.&nbsp;
All UPDATE operations are done on the basis of canonical names.
<p><a NAME="1.1.5"></a>1.1.5. The following RR types cannot be appended
to an RRset.&nbsp; If the following comparison rules are met, then an attempt
to add the new RR will result in the replacement of the previous RR:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">SOA</td>

<td>compare only NAME, CLASS and TYPE -- it is not possible to&nbsp; have
more than one SOA per zone, even if any of the data fields differ.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>WKS</td>

<td>compare only NAME, CLASS, TYPE, ADDRESS, and PROTOCOL&nbsp; - only
one WKS RR is possible for this tuple, even if the services masks differ.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>CNAME</td>

<td>compare only NAME, CLASS, and TYPE -- it is not possible&nbsp; to have
more than one CNAME RR, even if their data fields differ.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
<a NAME="1.2"></a>1.2 - Glue RRs</h3>
For the purpose of determining whether a domain name used in the UPDATE
protocol is contained within a specified zone, a domain name is "in" a
zone if it is owned by that zone's domain name.&nbsp; See section 7.18
for details.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="1.3"></a>1.3 - New Assigned Numbers</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp; CLASS = NONE (254)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; RCODE = YXDOMAIN (6)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; RCODE = YXRRSET (7)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; RCODE = NXRRSET (8)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; RCODE = NOTAUTH (9)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; RCODE = NOTZONE (10)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opcode = UPDATE (5)
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2 - Update Message Format</h2>
The DNS Message Format is defined by [RFC1035 4.1].&nbsp; Some extensions
are necessary (for example, more error codes are possible under UPDATE
than under QUERY) and some fields must be overloaded (see description of
CLASS fields below).
<p>The overall format of an UPDATE message is, following [ibid]:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Header&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Zone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | specifies the zone to
be updated</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prerequisite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| RRs or RRsets which must (not) preexist</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| RRs or RRsets to be added or deleted</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Data&nbsp;&nbsp; | additional
data</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; +---------------------+</tt>
<p>The Header Section specifies that this message is an UPDATE, and describes
the size of the other sections.&nbsp; The Zone Section names the zone that
is to be updated by this message.&nbsp; The Prerequisite Section specifies
the starting invariants (in terms of zone content) required for this update.&nbsp;
The Update Section contains the edits to be made, and the Additional Data
Section contains data which may be necessary to complete, but is not part
of, this update.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.1"></a>2.1 - Transport Issues</h3>
An update transaction may be carried in a UDP datagram, if the request
fits, or in a TCP connection (at the discretion of the requestor).&nbsp;
When TCP is used, the message is in the format described in [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.2.2.">RFC1035
4.2.2</a>].
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.2"></a>2.2 - Message Header</h3>
The header of the DNS Message Format is defined by [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.1.">RFC
1035 4.1</a>]. Not all opcodes define the same set of flag bits, though
as a practical matter most of the bits defined for QUERY (in [ibid]) are
identically defined by the other opcodes.&nbsp; UPDATE uses only one flag
bit (QR).
<p>The DNS Message Format specifies record counts for its four sections
(Question, Answer, Authority, and Additional).&nbsp; UPDATE uses the same
fields, and the same section formats, but the naming and use of these sections
differs as shown in the following modified header, after [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.1.1.">RFC1035
4.1.1</a>]:

<p>UPDATE uses this section to denote the zone of the records being updated.&nbsp;
All records to be updated must be in the same zone, and therefore the Zone
Section is allowed to contain exactly one record. The ZNAME is the zone
name, the ZTYPE must be SOA, and the ZCLASS is the zone's class.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.4"></a>2.4 - Prerequisite Section</h3>
This section contains a set of RRset prerequisites which must be satisfied
at the time the UPDATE packet is received by the primary master server.&nbsp;
The format of this section is as specified by [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.1.3.">RFC1035
4.1.3</a>].&nbsp; There are five possible sets of semantics that can be
expressed here, summarized as follows and then explained below.

</table>

<p>The syntax of these is as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.4.1"></a>2.4.1 - RRset Exists (Value Independent)</h4>
At least one RR with a specified NAME and TYPE (in the zone and class specified
in the Zone Section) must exist.
<p>For this prerequisite, a requestor adds to the section a single RR whose
NAME and TYPE are equal to that of the zone RRset whose existence is required.&nbsp;
RDLENGTH is zero and RDATA is therefore empty.&nbsp; CLASS must be specified
as ANY to differentiate this condition from that of an actual RR whose
RDLENGTH is naturally zero (0) (e.g., NULL).&nbsp; TTL is specified as
zero (0).
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.4.2"></a>2.4.2 - RRset Exists (Value Dependent)</h4>
A set of RRs with a specified NAME and TYPE exists and has the same members
with the same RDATAs as the RRset specified here in this section.&nbsp;
While RRset ordering is undefined and therefore not significant to this
comparison, the sets be identical in their extent.
<p>For this prerequisite, a requestor adds to the section an entire RRset
whose preexistence is required.&nbsp; NAME and TYPE are that of the RRset
being denoted.&nbsp; CLASS is that of the zone.&nbsp; TTL must be specified
as zero (0) and is ignored when comparing RRsets for identity.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.4.3"></a>2.4.3 - RRset Does Not Exist</h4>
No RRs with a specified NAME and TYPE (in the zone and class denoted by
the Zone Section) can exist.
<p>For this prerequisite, a requestor adds to the section a single RR whose
NAME and TYPE are equal to that of the RRset&nbsp; whose nonexistence is
required.&nbsp; The RDLENGTH of this record is zero (0), and RDATA field
is therefore empty.&nbsp; CLASS must be specified as NONE in order to distinguish
this condition from a valid RR whose RDLENGTH is naturally zero (0) (for
example, the NULL RR).&nbsp; TTL must be specified as zero (0).
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.4.4"></a>2.4.4 - Name Is In Use</h4>
Name is in use.&nbsp; At least one RR with a specified NAME (in the zone
and class specified by the Zone Section) must exist.&nbsp; Note that this
prerequisite is NOT satisfied by empty nonterminals.
<p>For this prerequisite, a requestor adds to the section a single RR whose
NAME is equal to that of the name whose ownership of an RR is required.&nbsp;
RDLENGTH is zero and RDATA is therefore empty.&nbsp; CLASS must be specified
as ANY to differentiate this condition from that of an actual RR whose
RDLENGTH is naturally zero (0) (e.g., NULL).&nbsp; TYPE must be specified
as ANY to differentiate this case from that of an RRset existence test.&nbsp;
TTL is specified as zero (0).
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.4.5"></a>2.4.5 - Name Is Not In Use</h4>
Name is not in use.&nbsp; No RR of any type is owned by a specified NAME.
Note that this prerequisite IS satisfied by empty nonterminals.
<p>For this prerequisite, a requestor adds to the section a single RR whose
NAME is equal to that of the name whose nonownership of any RRs is required.&nbsp;
RDLENGTH is zero and RDATA is therefore empty.&nbsp; CLASS must be specified
as NONE.&nbsp; TYPE must be specified as ANY.&nbsp; TTL must be specified
as zero (0).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.5"></a>2.5 - Update Section</h3>
This section contains RRs to be added to or deleted from the zone. The
format of this section is as specified by [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.1.3.">RFC1035
4.1.3</a>].&nbsp; There are four possible sets of semantics, summarized
below and with details to follow.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Add RRs to an RRset.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Delete an RRset.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Delete all RRsets from a name.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Delete an RR from an RRset.
<p>The syntax of these is as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.5.1"></a>2.5.1 - Add To An RRset</h4>
RRs are added to the Update Section whose NAME, TYPE, TTL, RDLENGTH and
RDATA are those being added, and CLASS is the same as the zone class.&nbsp;
Any duplicate RRs will be silently ignored by the primary master.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.5.2"></a>2.5.2 - Delete An RRset</h4>
One RR is added to the Update Section whose NAME and TYPE are those of
the RRset to be deleted.&nbsp; TTL must be specified as zero (0) and is
otherwise not used by the primary master.&nbsp; CLASS must be specified
as ANY.&nbsp; RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be empty.
If no such RRset exists, then this Update RR will be silently ignored by
the primary master.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.5.3"></a>2.5.3 - Delete All RRsets From A Name</h4>
One RR is added to the Update Section whose NAME is that of the name to
be cleansed of RRsets.&nbsp; TYPE must be specified as ANY.&nbsp; TTL must
be specified as zero (0) and is otherwise not used by the primary master.&nbsp;
CLASS must be specified as ANY.&nbsp; RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA
must therefore be empty.&nbsp; If no such RRsets exist, then this Update
RR will be silently ignored by the primary master.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="2.5.4"></a>2.5.4 - Delete An RR From An RRset</h4>
RRs to be deleted are added to the Update Section.&nbsp; The NAME, TYPE,
RDLENGTH and RDATA must match the RR being deleted.&nbsp; TTL must be specified
as zero (0) and will otherwise be ignored by the primary master.&nbsp;
CLASS must be specified as NONE to distinguish this from an RR addition.&nbsp;
If no such RRs exist, then this Update RR will be silently ignored by the
primary master.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.6"></a>2.6 - Additional Data Section</h3>
This section contains RRs which are related to the update itself, or to
new RRs being added by the update.&nbsp; For example, out of zone glue
(A RRs referred to by new NS RRs) should be presented here.&nbsp; The server
can use or ignore out of zone glue, at the discretion of the server implementor.&nbsp;
The format of this section is as specified by [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.1.3.">RFC1035
4.1.3</a>].
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3 - Server Behavior</h2>
A server, upon receiving an UPDATE request, will signal NOTIMP to the requestor
if the UPDATE opcode is not recognized or if it is recognized but has not
been implemented.&nbsp; Otherwise, processing continues as follows.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.1"></a>3.1 - Process Zone Section</h3>
<a NAME="3.1.1"></a>3.1.1. The Zone Section is checked to see that there
is exactly one RR therein and that the RR's ZTYPE is SOA, else signal FORMERR
to the requestor.&nbsp; Next, the ZNAME and ZCLASS are checked to see if
the zone so named is one of this server's authority zones, else signal
NOTAUTH to the requestor.&nbsp; If the server is a zone slave, the request
will be forwarded toward the primary master.
<p><a NAME="3.1.2"></a>3.1.2 - Pseudocode For Zone Section Processing
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if (zcount != 1 || ztype != SOA)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (FORMERR)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if (zone_type(zname, zclass) == SLAVE)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return forward()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if (zone_type(zname, zclass) == MASTER)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return update()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; return (NOTAUTH)</tt>
<p>Sections 3.2 through 3.8 describe the primary master's behaviour, whereas
Section 6 describes a forwarder's behaviour.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.2"></a>3.2 - Process Prerequisite Section</h3>
Next, the Prerequisite Section is checked to see that all prerequisites
are satisfied by the current state of the zone.&nbsp; Using the definitions
expressed in <a href="#1.2">Section 1.2</a>, if any RR's NAME is not within
the zone specified in the Zone Section, signal NOTZONE to the requestor.
<p><a NAME="3.2.1"></a>3.2.1. For RRs in this section whose CLASS is ANY,
test to see that TTL and RDLENGTH are both zero (0), else signal FORMERR
to the requestor.&nbsp; If TYPE is ANY, test to see that there is at least
one RR in the zone whose NAME is the same as that of the Prerequisite RR,
else signal NXDOMAIN to the requestor.&nbsp; If TYPE is not ANY, test to
see that there is at least one RR in the zone whose NAME and TYPE are the
same as that of the Prerequisite RR, else signal NXRRSET to the
<br>requestor.
<p><a NAME="3.2.2"></a>3.2.2. For RRs in this section whose CLASS is NONE,
test to see that the TTL and RDLENGTH are both zero (0), else signal FORMERR
to the requestor.&nbsp; If the TYPE is ANY, test to see that there are
no RRs in the zone whose NAME is the same as that of the Prerequisite RR,
else signal YXDOMAIN to the requestor.&nbsp; If the TYPE is not ANY, test
to see that there are no RRs in the zone whose NAME and TYPE are the same
as that of the Prerequisite RR, else signal YXRRSET to the
<br>requestor.
<p><a NAME="3.2.3"></a>3.2.3. For RRs in this section whose CLASS is the
same as the ZCLASS, test to see that the TTL is zero (0), else signal FORMERR
to the requestor.&nbsp; Then, build an RRset for each unique &lt;NAME,TYPE>
and compare each resulting RRset for set equality (same members, no more,
no less) with RRsets in the zone.&nbsp; If any Prerequisite RRset is not
entirely and exactly matched by a zone RRset, signal NXRRSET to the requestor.&nbsp;
If any RR in this section has a CLASS other than ZCLASS or NONE or ANY,
signal FORMERR to the requestor.

RRs named in the Update Section may be tested in an implementation dependent
fashion or using mechanisms specified in a subsequent Secure DNS Update
protocol.&nbsp; If the requestor does not have permission to perform these
updates, the server may write a warning message in its operations log,
and may either signal REFUSED to the requestor, or ignore the permission
problem and proceed with the update.

defined, if these verification activities are to be performed, this is
the point in the server's processing where such performance should take
place, since if a REFUSED condition is encountered after an update has
been partially applied, it will be necessary to undo the partial update
and restore the zone to its original state before answering the requestor.

<h3>
<a NAME="3.5"></a>3.5 - Stability</h3>
When a zone is modified by an UPDATE operation, the server must commit
the change to nonvolatile storage before sending a response to the requestor
or answering any queries or transfers for the modified zone.&nbsp; It is
reasonable for a server to store only the update records as long as a system
reboot or power failure will cause these update records to be incorporated
into the zone the next time the server is started.&nbsp; It is also reasonable
for the server to copy the entire modified zone to nonvolatile storage
after each update operation, though this would have suboptimal performance
for large zones.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.6"></a>3.6 - Zone Identity</h3>
If the zone's SOA SERIAL is changed by an update operation, that change
must be in a positive direction (using modulo 2**32 arithmetic as specified
by [<a href="rfc1982.html">RFC1982</a>]).&nbsp; Attempts to replace an
SOA with one whose SERIAL is less than the current one will be silently
ignored by the primary master server.
<p>If the zone's SOA's SERIAL is not changed as a result of an update operation,
then the server shall increment it automatically before the SOA or any
changed name or RR or RRset is included in any response or transfer.&nbsp;
The primary master server's implementor might choose to autoincrement the
SOA SERIAL if any of the following events occurs:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</td>

<td>Each update operation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>(2)</td>

<td>A name, RR or RRset in the zone has changed and has subsequently been
visible to a DNS client since the unincremented SOA was visible to a DNS
client, and the SOA is about to become visible to a DNS client.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>(3)</td>

<td>A configurable period of time has elapsed since the last update operation.&nbsp;
This period shall be less than or equal to one third of the zone refresh
time, and the default shall be the lesser of that maximum and 300 seconds.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>(4)</td>

<td>A configurable number of updates has been applied since the last SOA
change.&nbsp; The default value for this configuration parameter shall
be one hundred (100).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It is imperative that the zone's contents and the SOA's SERIAL be tightly
synchronized.&nbsp; If the zone appears to change, the SOA must appear
to change as well.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.7"></a>3.7 - Atomicity</h3>
During the processing of an UPDATE transaction, the server must ensure
atomicity with respect to other (concurrent) UPDATE or QUERY transactions.&nbsp;
No two transactions can be processed concurrently if either depends on
the final results of the other; in particular, a QUERY should not be able
to retrieve RRsets which have been partially modified by a concurrent UPDATE,
and an UPDATE should not be able to start from prerequisites that might
not still hold at the completion of some other concurrent UPDATE.&nbsp;
Finally, if two UPDATE transactions would modify the same names, RRs or
RRsets, then such UPDATE transactions must be serialized.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.8"></a>3.8 - Response</h3>
At the end of UPDATE processing, a response code will be known.&nbsp; A
response message is generated by copying the ID and Opcode fields from
the request, and either copying the ZOCOUNT, PRCOUNT, UPCOUNT, and ADCOUNT
fields and associated sections, or placing zeros (0) in the these "count"
fields and not including any part of the original update.&nbsp; The QR
bit is set to one (1), and the response is sent back to the requestor.&nbsp;
If the requestor used UDP, then the response will be sent to the requestor's
source UDP port.&nbsp; If the requestor used TCP, then the response will
be sent back on the requestor's open TCP
<br>connection.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4 - Requestor Behaviour</h2>
<a NAME="4.1"></a>4.1. From a requestor's point of view, any authoritative
server for the zone can appear to be able to process update requests, even
though only the primary master server is actually able to modify the zone's
master file.&nbsp; Requestors are expected to know the name of the zone
they intend to update and to know or be able to determine the name servers
for that zone.
<p><a NAME="4.2"></a>4.2. If update ordering is desired, the requestor
will need to know the value of the existing SOA RR.&nbsp; Requestors who
update the SOA RR must update the SOA SERIAL field in a positive direction
(as defined by [<a href="rfc1982.html">RFC1982</a>]) and also preserve
the other SOA fields unless the requestor's explicit intent is to change
them.&nbsp; The SOA SERIAL field must never be set to zero (0).
<p><a NAME="4.3"></a>4.3. If the requestor has reasonable cause to believe
that all of a zone's servers will be equally reachable, then it should
arrange to try the primary master server (as given by the SOA MNAME field
if matched by some NS NSDNAME) first to avoid unnecessary forwarding inside
the slave servers.&nbsp; (Note that the primary master will in some cases
not be reachable by all requestors, due to firewalls or network partitioning.)
<p><a NAME="4.4"></a>4.4. Once the zone's name servers been found and possibly
sorted so that the ones more likely to be reachable and/or support the
UPDATE opcode are listed first, the requestor composes an UPDATE message
of the following form and sends it to the first name server on its list:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(new)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opcode:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UPDATE</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone zcount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone zname:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(zone name)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone zclass:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(zone class)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone ztype:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
T_SOA</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prerequisite Section:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(see previous text)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Update Section:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(see previous text)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Data Section:&nbsp;&nbsp; (empty)</tt>
<p><a NAME="4.5"></a>4.5. If the requestor receives a response, and the
response has an RCODE other than SERVFAIL or NOTIMP, then the requestor
returns an appropriate response to its caller.
<p><a NAME="4.6"></a>4.6. If a response is received whose RCODE is SERVFAIL
or NOTIMP, or if no response is received within an implementation dependent
timeout period, or if an ICMP error is received indicating that the server's
port is unreachable, then the requestor will delete the unusable server
from its internal name server list and try the next one, repeating until
the name server list is empty.&nbsp; If the requestor runs out of servers
to try, an appropriate error will be returned to the requestor's caller.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5 - Duplicate Detection, Ordering and Mutual Exclusion</h2>
<a NAME="5.1"></a>5.1. For correct operation, mechanisms may be needed
to ensure idempotence, order UPDATE requests and provide mutual exclusion.&nbsp;
An UPDATE message or response might be delivered zero times, one time,
or multiple times.&nbsp; Datagram duplication is of particular interest
since it covers the case of the so-called "replay attack" where a correct
request is duplicated maliciously by an intruder.
<p><a NAME="5.2"></a>5.2. Multiple UPDATE requests or responses in transit
might be delivered in any order, due to network topology changes or load
balancing, or to multipath forwarding graphs wherein several slave servers
all forward to the primary master.&nbsp; In some cases, it might be required
that the earlier update not be applied after the later update, where "earlier"
and "later" are defined by an external time base visible to some set of
requestors, rather than by the order of request receipt at the primary
master.
<p><a NAME="5.3"></a>5.3. A requestor can ensure transaction idempotence
by explicitly deleting some "marker RR" (rather than deleting the RRset
of which it is a part) and then adding a new "marker RR" with a different
RDATA field.&nbsp; The Prerequisite Section should specify that the original
"marker RR" must be present in order for this UPDATE message to be accepted
by the server.
<p><a NAME="5.4"></a>5.4. If the request is duplicated by a network error,
all duplicate requests will fail since only the first will find the original
"marker RR" present and having its known previous value.&nbsp; The decisions
of whether to use such a "marker RR" and what RR to use are left up to
the application programmer, though one obvious choice is the zone's SOA
RR as described below.
<p><a NAME="5.5"></a>5.5. Requestors can ensure update ordering by externally
synchronizing their use of successive values of the "marker RR." Mutual
exclusion can be addressed as a degenerate case, in that a single succession
of the "marker RR" is all that is needed.
<p><a NAME="5.6"></a>5.6. A special case where update ordering and datagram
duplication intersect is when an RR validly changes to some new value and
then back to its previous value.&nbsp; Without a "marker RR" as described
above, this sequence of updates can leave the zone in an undefined state
if datagrams are duplicated.
<p><a NAME="5.7"></a>5.7. To achieve an atomic multitransaction "read-modify-write"
cycle, a requestor could first retrieve the SOA RR, and build an UPDATE
message one of whose prerequisites was the old SOA RR.&nbsp; It would then
specify updates that would delete this SOA RR and add a new one with an
incremented SOA SERIAL, along with whatever actual prerequisites and updates
were the object of the transaction.&nbsp; If the transaction succeeds,
the requestor knows that the RRs being changed were not otherwise altered
by any other requestor.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="6"></a>6 - Forwarding</h2>
When a zone slave forwards an UPDATE message upward toward the zone's primary
master server, it must allocate a new ID and prepare to enter the role
of "forwarding server," which is a requestor with respect to the forward
server.
<p><a NAME="6.1"></a>6.1. The set of forward servers will be same as the
set of servers this zone slave would use as the source of AXFR or IXFR
data.&nbsp; So, while the original requestor might have used the zone's
NS RRset to locate its update server, a forwarder always forwards toward
its designated zone master servers.
<p><a NAME="6.2"></a>6.2. If the original requestor used TCP, then the
TCP connection from the requestor is still open and the forwarder must
use TCP to forward the message.&nbsp; If the original requestor used UDP,
the forwarder may use either UDP or TCP to forward the message, at the
whim of the implementor.
<p><a NAME="6.3"></a>6.3. It is reasonable for forward servers to be forwarders
themselves, if the AXFR dependency graph being followed is a deep one involving
firewalls and multiple connectivity realms.&nbsp; In most cases the AXFR
dependency graph will be shallow and the forward server will be the primary
master server.
<p><a NAME="6.4"></a>6.4. The forwarder will not respond to its requestor
until it receives a response from its forward server.&nbsp; UPDATE transactions
involving forwarders are therefore time synchronized with respect to the
original requestor and the primary master server.
<p><a NAME="6.5"></a>6.5. When there are multiple possible sources of AXFR
data and therefore multiple possible forward servers, a forwarder will
use the same fallback strategy with respect to connectivity or timeout
errors that it would use when performing an AXFR.&nbsp; This is implementation
dependent.
<p><a NAME="6.6"></a>6.6. When a forwarder receives a response from a forward
server, it copies this response into a new response message, assigns its
requestor's ID to that message, and sends the response back to the requestor.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="7"></a>7 - Design, Implementation, Operation, and Protocol Notes</h2>
Some of the principles which guided the design of this UPDATE specification
are as follows.&nbsp; Note that these are not part of the formal specification
and any disagreement between this section and any other section of this
document should be resolved in favour of the other section.
<p><a NAME="7.1"></a>7.1. Using metavalues for CLASS is possible only because
all RRs in the packet are assumed to be in the same zone, and CLASS is
an attribute of a zone rather than of an RRset.&nbsp; (It is for this reason
that the Zone Section is not optional.)
<p><a NAME="7.2"></a>7.2. Since there are no data-present or data-absent
errors possible from processing the Update Section, any necessary data-present
and data- absent dependencies should be specified in the Prerequisite Section.
<p><a NAME="7.3"></a>7.3. The Additional Data Section can be used to supply
a server with out of zone glue that will be needed in referrals.&nbsp;
For example, if adding a new NS RR to HOME.VIX.COM specifying a nameserver
called NS.AU.OZ, the A RR for NS.AU.OZ can be included in the Additional
Data Section.&nbsp; Servers can use this information or ignore it, at the
discretion of the implementor.&nbsp; We discourage caching this information
for use in subsequent DNS responses.
<p><a NAME="7.4"></a>7.4. The Additional Data Section might be used if
some of the RRs later needed for Secure DNS Update are not actually zone
updates, but rather ancillary keys or signatures not intended to be stored
in the zone (as an update would be), yet necessary for validating the update
operation.
<p><a NAME="7.5"></a>7.5. It is expected that in the absence of Secure
DNS Update, a server will only accept updates if they come from a source
address that has been statically configured in the server's description
of a primary master zone.&nbsp; DHCP servers would be likely candidates
for inclusion in this statically configured list.
<p><a NAME="7.6"></a>7.6. It is not possible to create a zone using this
protocol, since there is no provision for a slave server to be told who
its master servers are.&nbsp; It is expected that this protocol will be
extended in the future to cover this case.&nbsp; Therefore, at this time,
the addition of SOA RRs is unsupported.&nbsp; For similar reasons, deletion
of SOA RRs is also unsupported.
<p><a NAME="7.7"></a>7.7. The prerequisite for specifying that a name own
at least one RR differs semantically from QUERY, in that QUERY would return
&lt;NOERROR,ANCOUNT=0> rather than NXDOMAIN if queried for an RRset at
this name, while UPDATE's prerequisite condition [<a href="#2.4.4">Section
2.4.4</a>] would NOT be satisfied.
<p><a NAME="7.8"></a>7.8. It is possible for a UDP response to be lost
in transit and for a request to be retried due to a timeout condition.&nbsp;
In this case an UPDATE that was successful the first time it was received
by the primary master might ultimately appear to have failed when the response
to a duplicate request is finally received by the requestor. (This is because
the original prerequisites may no longer be satisfied after the update
has been applied.)&nbsp; For this reason, requestors who require an accurate
response code must use TCP.
<p><a NAME="7.9"></a>7.9. Because a requestor who requires an accurate
response code will initiate their UPDATE transaction using TCP, a forwarder
who receives a request via TCP must forward it using TCP.
<p><a NAME="7.10"></a>7.10. Deferral of SOA SERIAL autoincrements is made
possible so that serial numbers can be conserved and wraparound at 2**32
can be made an infrequent occurance.&nbsp; Visible (to DNS clients) SOA
SERIALs need to differ if the zone differs.&nbsp; Note that the Authority
Section SOA in a QUERY response is a form of visibility, for the purposes
of this prerequisite.
<p><a NAME="7.11"></a>7.11. A zone's SOA SERIAL should never be set to
zero (0) due to interoperability problems with some older but widely installed
implementations of DNS.&nbsp; When incrementing an SOA SERIAL, if the result
of the increment is zero (0) (as will be true when wrapping around 2**32),
it is necessary to increment it again or set it to one (1).&nbsp; See [<a href="rfc1982.html">RFC1982</a>]
for more detail on this subject.
<p><a NAME="7.12"></a>7.12. Due to the TTL minimalization necessary when
caching an RRset,&nbsp; it is recommended that all TTLs in an RRset be
set to the same value. While the DNS Message Format permits variant TTLs
to exist in the same RRset, and this variance can exist inside a zone,
such variance will have counterintuitive results and its use is discouraged.
<p><a NAME="7.13"></a>7.13. Zone cut management presents some obscure corner
cases to the add and delete operations in the Update Section.&nbsp; It
is possible to delete an NS RR as long as it is not the last NS RR at the
root of a zone.&nbsp; If deleting all RRs from a name, SOA and NS RRs at
the root of a zone are unaffected.&nbsp; If deleting RRsets, it is not
possible to delete either SOA or NS RRsets at the top of a zone.&nbsp;
An attempt to add an SOA will be treated as a replace operation if an SOA
already exists, or as a no-op if the SOA would be new.
<p><a NAME="7.14"></a>7.14. No semantic checking is required in the primary
master server when adding new RRs.&nbsp; Therefore a requestor can cause
CNAME or NS or any other kind of RR to be added even if their target name
does not exist or does not have the proper RRsets to make the original
RR useful.&nbsp; Primary master servers that DO implement this kind of
checking should take great care to avoid out-of-zone dependencies (whose
veracity cannot be authoritatively checked) and should implement all such
checking during the prescan phase.
<p><a NAME="7.15"></a>7.15. Nonterminal or wildcard CNAMEs are not well
specified by [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC1035</a>] and their use
will probably lead to unpredictable results. Their use is discouraged.
<p><a NAME="7.16"></a>7.16. Empty nonterminals (nodes with children but
no RRs of their own) will cause &lt;NOERROR,ANCOUNT=0> responses to be
sent in response to a query of any type for that name.&nbsp; There is no
provision for empty terminal nodes -- so if all RRs of a terminal node
are deleted, the name is no longer in use, and queries of any type for
that name will result in an NXDOMAIN response.
<p><a NAME="7.17"></a>7.17. In a deep AXFR dependency graph, it has not
historically been an error for slaves to depend mutually upon each other.&nbsp;
This configuration has been used to enable a zone to flow from the primary
master to all slaves even though not all slaves have continuous connectivity
to the primary master.&nbsp; UPDATE's use of the AXFR dependency graph
for forwarding prohibits this kind of dependency loop, since UPDATE forwarding
has no loop detection analagous to the SOA SERIAL pretest used by AXFR.
<p><a NAME="7.18"></a>7.18. Previously existing names which are occluded
by a new zone cut are still considered part of the parent zone, for the
purposes of zone transfers, even though queries for such names will be
referred to the new subzone's servers.&nbsp; If a zone cut is removed,
all parent zone names that were occluded by it will again become visible
to queries.&nbsp; (This is a clarification of [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a>].)
<p><a NAME="7.19"></a>7.19. If a server is authoritative for both a zone
and its child, then queries for names at the zone cut between them will
be answered authoritatively using only data from the child zone.&nbsp;
(This is a clarification of [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a>].)
<p><a NAME="7.20"></a>7.20. Update ordering using the SOA RR is problematic
since there is no way to know which of a zone's NS RRs represents the primary
master, and the zone slaves can be out of date if their SOA.REFRESH timers
have not elapsed since the last time the zone was changed on the primary
master.&nbsp; We recommend that a zone needing ordered updates use only
servers which implement NOTIFY (see [<a href="rfc1996.html">RFC1996</a>])
and IXFR (see [<a href="rfc1995.html">RFC1995</a>]), and that a client
receiving a prerequisite error while attempting an ordered update simply
retry after a random delay period to allow the zone to settle.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="8"></a>8 - Security Considerations</h2>
<a NAME="8.1"></a>8.1. In the absence of [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2137.txt">RFC2137</a>]
or equivalent technology, the protocol described by this document makes
it possible for anyone who can reach an authoritative name server to alter
the contents of any zones on that server.&nbsp; This is a serious increase
in vulnerability from the current technology.&nbsp; Therefore it is very
strongly recommended that the protocols described in this document not
be used without [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2137.txt">RFC2137</a>]
or other equivalently strong security measures, e.g. IPsec.
<p><a NAME="8.2"></a>8.2. A denial of service attack can be launched by
flooding an update forwarder with TCP sessions containing updates that
the primary master server will ultimately refuse due to permission problems.
This arises due to the requirement that an update forwarder receiving a
request via TCP use a synchronous TCP session for its forwarding operation.&nbsp;
The connection management mechanisms of [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html#4.2.2.">RFC1035
4.2.2</a>] are sufficient to prevent large scale damage from such an attack,
but not to prevent some queries from going unanswered during the attack.
