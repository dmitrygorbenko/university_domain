<a NAME="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
There has been much discussion and several documents written about the
need for an Internet Directory.&nbsp; Recently, this discussion has focused
on ways to discover an organization's domain name without relying on use
of DNS as a directory service.&nbsp; This memo discusses lessons that were
learned during InterNIC Directory and Database Services' development and
operation of WWWSeeker, an application that finds a web site given information
about the name and location of an organization.&nbsp; The back end database
that drives this application was built from information obtained from domain
registries via WHOIS and other protocols.&nbsp; We present this information
to help future implementors avoid some of the blind alleys that we have
already explored.&nbsp; This work builds on the Netfind system that was
created by Mike Schwartz and his team at the University of Colorado at
Boulder [<a href="#ref1">1</a>].

<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
Over time, there have been several RFCs [<a href="#ref2">2, 3, 4</a>] about
approaches for providing Internet Directories.&nbsp; Many of the earlier
documents discussed white pages directories that supply mappings from a
person's name to their telephone number, email address, etc.
<p>More recently, there has been discussion of directories that map from
a company name to a domain name or web site.&nbsp; Many people are using
DNS as a directory today to find this type of information about a given
company.&nbsp; Typically when DNS is used, users guess the domain name
of the company they are looking for and then prepend "www.". This makes
it highly desirable for a company to have an easily guessable name.
<p>There are two major problems here.&nbsp; As the number of assigned names
increases, it becomes more difficult to get an easily guessable name. Also,
the TLD must be guessed as well as the name.&nbsp; While many users just
guess ".COM" as the "default" TLD today, there are many two-letter country
code top-level domains in current use as well as other gTLDs (.NET, .ORG,
and possibly .EDU) with the prospect of additional gTLDs in the future.&nbsp;
As the number of TLDs in general use increases, guessing gets more difficult.
<p>Between July 1996 and our shutdown in March 1998, the InterNIC Directory
and Database Services project maintained the Netfind search engine [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]
and the associated database that maps organization information to domain
names. This database thus acted as the type of Internet directory that
associates company names with domain names. We also built WWWSeeker, a
system that used the Netfind database to find web sites associated with
a given organization.&nbsp; The experienced gained from maintaining and
growing this database provides valuable insight into the issues of providing
a directory service.&nbsp; We present it here to allow future implementors
to avoid some of the blind alleys that we have already explored.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. Directory Population</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="2.1"></a>2.1 What to do?</h3>
There are two issues in populating a directory: finding all the domain
names (building the skeleton) and associating those domains with entities
(adding the meat).&nbsp; These two issues are discussed below.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.2"></a>2.2 Building the skeleton</h3>
In "building the skeleton", it is popular to suggest using a variant of
a "tree walk" to determine the domains that need to be added to the directory.&nbsp;
Our experience is that this is neither a reasonable nor an efficient proposal
for maintaining such a directory.&nbsp; Except for some infrequent and
long-standing DNS surveys [<a href="#ref5">5</a>], DNS "tree walks" tend
to be discouraged by the Internet community, especially given that the
frequency of DNS changes would require a new tree walk monthly (if not
more often).&nbsp; Instead, our experience has shown that data on allocated
DNS domains can usually be retrieved in bulk fashion with FTP, HTTP, or
Gopher (we have used each of these for particular TLDs).&nbsp; This has
the added advantage of both "building the skeleton" and "adding the meat"
at the same time.&nbsp; Our favorite method for finding a server that has
allocated DNS domain information is to start with the list maintained at
<a href="http://www.alldomains.com/countryindex.html">http://www.alldomains.com/countryindex.html</a>
and go from there.
<br>Before this was available, it was necessary to hunt for a registry
using trial and error.
<p>When maintaining the database, existing domains may be verified via
direct DNS lookups rather than a "tree walk." "Tree walks" should therefore
be the choice of last resort for directory population, and bulk retrieval
should be used whenever possible.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.3"></a>2.3 Adding the meat</h3>
A possibility for populating a directory ("adding the meat") is to use
an automated system that makes repeated queries using the WHOIS protocol
to gather information about the organization that owns a domain.&nbsp;
The queries would be made against a WHOIS server located with the above
method. At the conclusion of the InterNIC Directory and Database Services
project, our backend database contained about 2.9 million records built
from data that could be retrieved via WHOIS.&nbsp; The entire database
contained 3.25 million records, with the additional records coming from
sources other than WHOIS.
<p>In our experience this information contains many factual and typographical
errors and requires further examination and processing to improve its quality.&nbsp;
Further, TLD registrars that support WHOIS typically only support WHOIS
information for second level domains (i.e. ne.us) as opposed to lower level
domains (i.e. windrose.omaha.ne.us).&nbsp; Also, there are TLDs without
registrars, TLDs without WHOIS support, and still other TLDs that use other
methods (HTTP, FTP, gopher) for providing organizational information.&nbsp;
Based on our experience, an implementor of an internet directory needs
to support multiple protocols for directory population.&nbsp; An automated
WHOIS search tool is necessary, but isn't enough.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. Directory Updating: Full Rebuilds vs Incremental Updates</h2>
Given the size of our database in April 1998 when it was last generated,
a complete rebuild of the database that is available from WHOIS lookups
would require between 134.2 to 167.8 days just for WHOIS lookups from a
Sun SPARCstation 20. This estimate does not include other considerations
(for example, inverting the token tree required about 24 hours processing
time on a Sun SPARCstation 20) that would increase the amount of time to
rebuild the entire database.
<p>Whether this is feasible depends on the frequency of database updates
provided.&nbsp; Because of the rate of growth of allocated domain names
(150K-200K new allocated domains per month in early 1998), we provided
monthly updates of the database. To rebuild the database each month (based
on the above time estimate) would require between 3 and 5 machines to be
dedicated full time (independent of machine architecture).&nbsp; Instead,
we checkpointed the allocated domain list and rebuild on an incremental
basis during one weekend of the month. This allowed us to complete the
update on between 1 and 4 machines (3 Sun SPARCstation 20s and a dual-processor
Sparcserver 690) without full dedication over a couple of days.&nbsp; Further,
by coupling incremental updates with periodic refresh of existing data
(which can be done during another part of the month and doesn't require
full dedication of machine hardware), older records would be periodically
updated when the underlying information changes.&nbsp; The tradeoff is
timeliness and accuracy of data (some data in the database may be old)
against hardware and processing costs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Directory Presentation: Distributed vs Monolithic</h2>
While a distributed directory is a desirable goal, we maintained our database
as a monolithic structure.&nbsp; Given past growth, it is not clear at
what point migrating to a distributed directory becomes actually necessary
to support customer queries.&nbsp; Our last database contained over 3.25
million records in a flat ASCII file.&nbsp; Searching was done via a PERL
script of an inverted tree (also produced by a PERL script).&nbsp; While
admittedly primitive, this configuration supported over 200,000 database
queries per month from our production servers.
<p>Increasing the database size only requires more disk space to hold the
database and inverted tree. Of course, using database technology would
probably improve performance and scalability, but we had not reached the
point where this technology was required.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Security Considerations</h2>
The underlying data for the type of directory discussed in this document
is already generally available through WHOIS, DNS, and other standard interfaces.&nbsp;
No new information is made available by using these techniques though many
types of search become much easier.&nbsp; To the extent that easier access
to this data makes it easier to find specific sites or machines to attack,
security may be decreased.
<p>The protocols discussed here do not have built-in security features.
If one source machine is spoofed while the directory data is being gathered,
substantial amounts of incorrect and misleading data could be pulled in
to the directory and be spread to a wider audience.
<p>In general, building a directory from registry data will not open any
new security holes since the data is already available to the public. Existing
security and accuracy problems with the data sources are likely to be amplified.
