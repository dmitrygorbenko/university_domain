Abstract</H2>
It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually CNAMEs)
in the Domain Name Service (DNS - <A HREF="rfc1034.txt">RFC 1034</A>, <A HREF="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC
1035</A>]) to refer to network services such as anonymous FTP [<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc959.txt">RFC
959</A>] servers, Gopher [<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1436.txt">RFC
1436</A>] servers, and most notably World-Wide Web HTTP [<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1945.txt">RFC
1945</A>] servers.&nbsp; This is desirable for a number of reasons.&nbsp;
It provides a way of moving services from one machine to another transparently,
and a mechanism by which people or agents may programmatically discover
that an organization runs, say, a World-Wide Web server.

<P>Although this approach has been almost universally adopted, there is
no standards document or similar specification for these commonly used
names.&nbsp; This document seeks to rectify this situation by gathering
together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and proposes a mechanism
for accommodating new protocols.

<P>It is important to note that these naming conventions do not provide
a complete long term solution to the problem of finding a particular network
service for a site.&nbsp; There are efforts in other IETF working groups
to address the long term solution to this problem, such as the Server Location
Resource Records (DNS SRV) [<A HREF="rfc2052.txt">RFC 2052</A>] work.

<A NAME="1.Rationale"></A>1. Rationale</H2>
In order to locate the network services offered at a particular Internet
domain one is faced with the choice of selecting from a growing number
of centralized databases - typically Web or Usenet News "wanderers", or
attempting to infer the existence of network services from whatever DNS
information may be available.&nbsp; The former approach is not practical
in some cases, notably when the entity seeking service information is a
program.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Perhaps the most visible example of the latter approach at work is
in the case of World-Wide Web HTTP servers.&nbsp; It is common practice
to try prefixing the domain name of an organization with "http://www."
in order to reach its World-Wide Web site, e.g. taking "hivnet.fr" and
arriving at "http://www.hivnet.fr."&nbsp; Some popular World-Wide Web browsers
have gone so far as to provide automatic support for this domain name expansion.

<P>Ideally, the DNS or some complementary directory service would provide
a means for programs to determine automatically the network services which
are offered at a particular Internet domain, the protocols which are used
to deliver them, and other technical information.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
although much work has been done to develop said directory service technologies
and to define new types of DNS resource record to provide this type of
information, there is no widely agreed upon or widely deployed solution
to the problem - except in a small number of cases.

<P>The first case is where the DNS already provides a lookup capability
for the type of information being sought after.&nbsp; For example: Mail
Exchanger (MX) records specify how mail to a particular domain should be
routed [<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc974.txt">RFC 974</A>], the Start
of Authority (SOA) records make it possible to determine who is responsible
for a given domain, and Name Server (NS) records indicate which hosts provide
DNS name service for a given domain.

<P>The second case is where the DNS does not provide an appropriate lookup
capability, but there is some widely accepted convention for finding this
information.&nbsp; Some use has been made of Text (TXT) [<A
HREF="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC
1035</A>] records in this scenario, but in the vast majority of cases a
Canonical Name (CNAME) or Address (A) record pointer is used to indicate
the host or hosts which provide the service.&nbsp; This document proposes
a slight formalization of this well-known alias approach.

<P>It should be noted that the DNS provides a Well Known Services (WKS)
[<A HREF="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC 1035</A>] lookup capability, which makes it
possible to determine the network services offered at a given domain name.&nbsp;
In practice this is not widely used, perhaps because of the absence of
a suitable programming interface.&nbsp; Use of WKS for mail routing was
deprecated in the Host Requirements specification [<A HREF="rfc1123.txt">RFC
1123</A>] in favour of the MX record, and in the long term it is conceivable
that SRV records will supersede both WKS and MX.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="2. A generic framework"></A>2. A Generic Framework</H2>
Our approach to dealing with aliases for protocols is straightforward.
We define a standard set of DNS aliases for the most popular network services
that currently exist (see the "Special Cases" section below). For protocols
that are not explicitly listed in this document, the protocol specification
must propose a name.

<A NAME="4. (Ab)Use"></A>4. (Ab)Use of the DNS as a Directory Service</H2>
The widespread use of these common aliases effectively means that it is
sometimes possible to "guess" the domain names associated with an organization's
network services, though this is becoming more difficult as the number
of organizations registered in the DNS increases.

<P>It should be understood by implementors that the existence of a DNS
entry such as

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.hivnet.fr

<P>does not constitute a registration of a World-Wide Web service. There
is no requirement that the domain name resolve to an IP address or addresses.&nbsp;
There is no requirement that a host be listening for HTTP connections,
or if it is, that the HTTP server be running on port 80.&nbsp; Finally,
even if all of these things are true, there can be no guarantee that the
World-Wide Web server will be prepared to honor requests from arbitrary
clients.

<P>Having said this, the aliases do provide useful "hints" about the services
offered.&nbsp; We propose that they be taken in this spirit.

<P>The conventions described in this document are, essentially, only useful
when the organization's domain name can be determined - e.g. from some
external database.&nbsp; A number of groups, including the IETF, have been
working on ways of finding domain names given a set of information such
as organization name, location, and business type. It is hoped that one
or more of these will eventually make it possible to augment the basic
lookup service which the DNS provides with a more generalized search and
retrieval capability.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="5. DNS Server Config"></A>5. DNS Server Configuration</H2>
In the short term, whilst directory service technology and further types
of DNS resource record are being developed, domain name administrators
are encouraged to use these common names for the network services they
run.&nbsp; They will make it easier for outsiders to find information about
your organization, and also make it easier for you to move services from
one machine to another.

<P>There are two conventional approaches to creating these DNS entries.
One is to add a single CNAME record to your DNS server's configuration,
e.g.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ph.hivnet.fr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baby.hivnet.fr.

<P>Note that in this scenario no information about ph.hivnet.fr should
exist in the DNS other than the CNAME record. For example, ph.hivnet.fr
could not contain a MX record.

<P>An alternative approach would be to create an A record for each of the
IP addresses associated with ph.hivnet.fr, e.g.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ph.hivnet.fr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 194.167.157.2

<P>It isn't a simple matter of recommending CNAMEs over A records. Each
site has it's own set of requirements that may make one approach better
than the other. RFC 1912 [<A HREF="rfc1912.html">RFC 1912</A>]&nbsp; discusses
some of the configuration issues involved in using CNAMEs.

<P>Recent DNS server implementations provide a "round-robin" feature which
causes the host's IP addresses to be returned in a different order each
time the address is looked up.

<P>Network clients are starting to appear which, when they encounter a
host with multiple addresses, use heuristics to determine the address to
contact - e.g. picking the one which has the shortest round-trip- time.&nbsp;
Thus, if a server is mirrored (replicated) at a number of locations, it
may be desirable to list the IP addresses of the mirror servers as A records
of the primary server.&nbsp; This is only likely to be appropriate if the
mirror servers are exact copies of the original server.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="6. Limitations"></A>6. Limitations of this Approach</H2>
Some services require that a client have more information than the server's
domain name.&nbsp; For example, an LDAP client needs to know a starting
search base within the Directory Information Tree in order to have a meaningful
dialogue with the server.&nbsp; This document does not attempt to address
this problem.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="7. CCSO Service Name"></A>7. CCSO Service Name</H2>
There are currently at least three different aliases in common use for
the CCSO nameserver - e.g. "ph", "cso" and "ns".&nbsp; It would appear
to be in everyone's interest to narrow the choice of alias down to a single
name.&nbsp; "ns" would seem to be the best choice since it is the most
commonly used name.&nbsp; However, "ns" is also being used by DNS to point
to the DNS server.&nbsp; In fact, the most prevalent use of "ns" is to
name DNS servers.&nbsp; For this reason, we suggest the use of "ph" as
the best name to use for CCSO nameservers.

<P>Sites with existing CCSO servers using some of these aliases may find
it desirable to use all three.&nbsp; This increases the likelihood of the
service being found.

<P>As noted earlier, implementations should be resilient in the event that
the name does not point to the expected service.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="8. Security"></A>8. Security Considerations</H2>
The DNS is open to many kinds of "spoofing" attacks, and it cannot be guaranteed
that the result returned by a DNS lookup is indeed the genuine information.&nbsp;
Spoofing may take the form of denial of service, such as directing of the
client to a non-existent address, or a passive attack such as an intruder's
server which masquerades as the legitimate one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Work is ongoing to remedy this situation insofar as the DNS is concerned
[<A HREF="rfc2065.html">RFC 2065</A>].&nbsp; In the meantime it should be
noted that stronger authentication mechanisms such as public key cryptography
with large key sizes are a pre-requisite if the DNS is being used in any
sensitive situations.&nbsp; Examples of these would be on-line financial
transactions, and any situation where privacy is a concern - such as the
querying of medical records over the network.&nbsp; Strong encryption of
the network traffic may also be advisable, to protect against TCP connection
"hijacking" and packet sniffing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="9. Conclusions"></A>9. Conclusions</H2>
The service names listed in this document provide a sensible set of defaults
which may be used as an aid in determining the hosts which offer particular
services for a given domain name.

<P>This document has noted some exceptions which are either inherently
unsuitable for this treatment, or already have a substantial installed
base using alternative aliases.
