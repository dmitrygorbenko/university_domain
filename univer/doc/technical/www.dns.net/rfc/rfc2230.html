Abstract</H2>
This note describes a mechanism whereby authorisation for one node to act
as key exchanger for a second node is delegated and made available via
the Secure DNS.&nbsp; This mechanism is intended to be used only with the
Secure DNS.&nbsp; It can be used with several security services.&nbsp;
For example, a system seeking to use IP Security [<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc825.txt">RFC825</A>,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1826.txt">RFC1826</A>, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1827.txt">RFC1827</A>]
to protect IP packets for a given destination can use this mechanism to
determine the set of authorised remote key exchanger systems for that destination.

<A NAME="INTRODUCTION"></A>1. INTRODUCTION</H2>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the standard way that Internet nodes locate
information about addresses, mail exchangers, and other data relating to
remote Internet nodes. [<A HREF="rfc1035/">RFC1035</A>,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</A>] More recently,
Eastlake and Kaufman have defined standards-track security extensions to
the DNS. [<A HREF="rfc2065.html">RFC2065</A>] These
security extensions can be used to authenticate signed DNS data records
and can also be used to store signed public keys in the DNS.

<P>The KX record is useful in providing an authenticatible method of delegating
authorisation for one node to provide key exchange services on behalf of
one or more, possibly different, nodes.&nbsp; This note specifies the syntax
and semantics of the KX record, which is currently in limited deployment
in certain IP-based networks.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reader is assumed to be familiar
with the basics of DNS, including familiarity with [<A HREF="rfc1035/">RFC1035</A>,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</A>].&nbsp; This document
is not on the IETF standards-track and does not specify any level of standard.
This document merely provides information for the Internet community.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="Identity Twrminology"></A>1.1 Identity Terminology</H3>
This document relies upon the concept of "identity domination".&nbsp; This
concept might be new to the reader and so is explained in this section.&nbsp;
The subject of endpoint naming for security associations has historically
been somewhat contentious.&nbsp; This document takes no position on what
forms of identity should be used.&nbsp; In a network, there are several
forms of identity that are possible.

<P>For example, IP Security has defined notions of identity that include:
IP Address, IP Address Range, Connection ID, Fully-Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN), and User with Fully Qualified Domain Name (USER FQDN).

<P>A USER FQDN identity dominates a FQDN identity.&nbsp; A FQDN identity
in turn dominates an IP Address identity.&nbsp; Similarly, a Connection
ID dominates an IP Address identity.&nbsp; An IP Address Range dominates
each IP Address identity for each IP address within that IP address range.
Also, for completeness, an IP Address identity is considered to dominate
itself.
<H2>
<A NAME="2. APPROACH"></A>2. APPROACH</H2>
This document specifies a new kind of DNS Resource Record (RR), known as
the Key Exchanger (KX) record.&nbsp; A Key Exchanger Record has the mnemonic
"KX" and the type code of 36.&nbsp; Each KX record is associated with a
fully-qualified domain name.&nbsp; The KX record is modeled on the MX record
described in [Part86]. Any given domain, subdomain, or host entry in the
DNS might have a KX record.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="2.1 IPsec Examples"></A>2.1 IPsec Examples</H3>
In these two examples, let S be the originating node and let D be the destination
node.&nbsp; S2 is another node on the same subnet as S.&nbsp; D2 is another
node on the same subnet as D.&nbsp; R1 and R2 are IPsec-capable routers.&nbsp;
The path from S to D goes via first R1 and later R2.&nbsp; The return path
from D to S goes via first R2 and later R1.

<P>IETF-standard IP Security uses unidirectional Security Associations
[<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1825.txt">RFC1825</A>].&nbsp; Therefore,
a typical IP session will use a pair of related Security Associations,
one in each direction.&nbsp; The examples below talk about how to setup
an example Security Association, but in practice a pair of matched Security
Associations will normally be used.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="2.1.1 Subnet-to-Subnet Example"></A>2.1.1 Subnet-to-Subnet Example</H4>
If neither S nor D implements IPsec, security can still be provided between
R1 and R2 by building a secure tunnel.&nbsp; This can use either AH or
ESP.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 1:&nbsp; Network Diagram for Subnet-to-Subnet
Example

<P>In this example, R1 makes the policy decision to provide the IPsec service
for traffic from R1 destined for R2.&nbsp; Once R1 has decided that the
packet from S to D should be protected, it performs a secure DNS lookup
for the records associated with domain D.&nbsp; If R1 only knows the IP
address for D, then a secure reverse DNS lookup will be necessary to determine
the domain D, before that forward secure DNS lookup for records associated
with domain D.&nbsp; If these DNS records of domain D include a KX record
for the IPsec service, then R1 knows which set of nodes are authorised
key exchanger nodes for the destination D.

<P>In this example, let there be at least one KX record for D and let the
most preferred KX record for D point at R2.&nbsp; R1 then selects a key
exchanger (in this example, R2) for D from the list obtained from the secure
DNS.&nbsp; Then R1 initiates a key management session with that key exchanger
(in this example, R2) to setup an IPsec Security Association between R1
and D.&nbsp; In this example, R1 knows (either by seeing an outbound packet
arriving from S destined to D or via other methods) that S will be sending
traffic to D.&nbsp; In this example R1's policy requires that traffic from
S to D should be segregated at least on a host-to-host basis, so R1 desires
an IPsec Security Association with source identity that dominates S, proxy
identity that dominates R1, and destination identity that dominates R2.

<P>In turn, R2 is able to authenticate the delegation of Key Exchanger
authorisation for target S to R1 by making an authenticated forward DNS
lookup for KX records associated with S and verifying that at least one
such record points to R1.&nbsp; The identity S is typically given to R2
as part of the key management process between R1 and R2.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If D initially only knows the IP address of S, then it will need to
perform a secure reverse DNS lookup to obtain the fully-qualified domain
name for S prior to that secure forward DNS lookup.

<P>If R2 does not receive an authenticated DNS response indicating that
R1 is an authorised key exchanger for S, then D will not accept the SA
negotiation from R1 on behalf of identity S.

<P>If the proposed IPsec Security Association is acceptable to both R1
and R2, each of which might have separate policies, then they create that
IPsec Security Association via Key Management.

<P>Note that for unicast traffic, Key Management will typically also setup
a separate (but related) IPsec Security Association for the return traffic.&nbsp;
That return IPsec Security Association will have equivalent identities.&nbsp;
In this example, that return IPsec Security Association will have a source
identity that dominates D, a proxy identity that dominates R2, and a destination
identity that dominates R1.

<P>Once the IPsec Security Association has been created, then R1 uses it
to protect traffic from S destined for D via a secure tunnel that originates
at R1 and terminates at R2.&nbsp; For the case of unicast, R2 will use
the return IPsec Security Association to protect traffic from D destined
for S via a secure tunnel that originates at R2 and terminates at R1.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="2.1.2 Subnet-to-Host Example"></A>2.1.2 Subnet-to-Host Example</H4>
Consider the case where D and R1 implement IPsec, but S does not implement
IPsec, which is an interesting variation on the previous example.&nbsp;
This example is shown in Figure 2 below.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 2:&nbsp; Network Diagram for Subnet-to-Host
Example

<P>In this example, R1 makes the policy decision that IP Security is needed
for the packet travelling from S to D.&nbsp; Then, R1 performs the secure
DNS lookup for D and determines that D is its own key exchanger, either
from the existence of a KX record for D pointing to D or from an authenticated
DNS response indicating that no KX record exists for D.&nbsp; If R1 does
not initially know the domain name of D, then prior to the above forward
secure DNS lookup, R1 performs a secure reverse DNS lookup on the IP address
of D to determine the fully-qualified domain name for that IP address.&nbsp;
R1 then initiates key management with D to create an IPsec Security Association
on behalf of S.

<P>In turn, D can verify that R1 is authorised to create an IPsec Security
Association on behalf of S by performing a DNS KX record lookup for target
S.&nbsp; R1 usually provides identity S to D via key management.&nbsp;
If D only has the IP address of S, then D will need to perform a secure
reverse lookup on the IP address of S to determine domain name S prior
to the secure forward DNS lookup on S to locate the KX records for S.

<P>If D does not receive an authenticated DNS response indicating that
R1 is an authorised key exchanger for S, then D will not accept the SA
negotiation from R1 on behalf of identity S.

<P>If the IPsec Security Association is successfully established between
R1 and D, that IPsec Security Association has a source identity that dominates
S's IP address, a proxy identity that dominates R1's IP address, and a
destination identity that dominates D's IP address.

<P>Finally, R1 begins providing the security service for packets from S
that transit R1 destined for D.&nbsp; When D receives such packets, D examines
the SA information during IPsec input processing and sees that R1's address
is listed as valid proxy address for that SA and that S is the source address
for that SA.&nbsp; Hence, D knows at input processing time that R1 is authorised
to provide security on behalf of S.&nbsp; Therefore packets coming from
R1 with valid IP security that claim to be from S are trusted by D to have
really come from S.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="2.1.3 Host to Subnet Example"></A>2.1.3 Host to Subnet Example</H4>
Now consider the above case from D's perspective (i.e. where D is sending
IP packets to S).&nbsp; This variant is sometimes known as the Mobile Host
or "roadwarrier" case. The same basic concepts apply, but the details are
covered here in hope of improved clarity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 3:&nbsp; Network Diagram for Host-to-Subnet
Example
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>In this example, D makes the policy decision that IP Security is needed
for the packets from D to S.&nbsp; Then D performs the secure DNS lookup
for S and discovers that a KX record for S exists and points at R1.&nbsp;
If D only has the IP address of S, then it performs a secure reverse DNS
lookup on the IP address of S prior to the forward secure DNS lookup for
S.

<P>D then initiates key management with R1, where R1 is acting on behalf
of S, to create an appropriate Security Association.&nbsp; Because D is
acting as its own key exchanger, R1 does not need to perform a secure DNS
lookup for KX records associated with D.

<P>D and R1 then create an appropriate IPsec Security Security Association.&nbsp;
This IPsec Security Association is setup as a secure tunnel with a source
identity that dominates D's IP Address and a destination identity that
dominates R1's IP Address.&nbsp; Because D performs IPsec for itself, no
proxy identity is needed in this IPsec Security Association.&nbsp; If the
proxy identity is non-null in this situation, then the proxy identity must
dominate D's IP Address.

<P>Finally, D sends secured IP packets to R1.&nbsp; R1 receives those packets,
provides IPsec input processing (including appropriate inner/outer IP address
validation), and forwards valid packets along to S.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="2.2 Other Examples"></A>2.2 Other Examples</H3>
This mechanism can be extended for use with other services as well. To
give some insight into other possible uses, this section discusses use
of KX records in environments using a Key Distribution Center (KDC), such
as Kerberos [KN93], and a possible use of KX records in conjunction with
mobile nodes accessing the network via a dialup service.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="2.2.1 KDC Examples"></A>2.2.1 KDC Examples</H4>
This example considers the situation of a destination node implementing
IPsec that can only obtain its Security Association information from a
Key Distribution Center (KDC).&nbsp; Let the KDC implement both the KDC
protocol and also a non-KDC key management protocol (e.g. ISAKMP).&nbsp;
In such a case, each client node of the KDC might have its own KX record
pointing at the KDC so that nodes not implementing the KDC protocol can
still create Security Associations with each of the client nodes of the
KDC.

<P>In the event the session initiator were not using the KDC but the session
target was an IPsec node that only used the KDC, the initiator would find
the KX record for the target pointing at the KDC.&nbsp; Then, the external
key management exchange (e.g. ISAKMP) would be between the initiator and
the KDC.&nbsp; Then the KDC would distribute the IPsec SA to the KDC-only
IPsec node using the KDC.&nbsp; The IPsec traffic itself could travel directly
between the initiator and the destination node.

<P>In the event the initiator node could only use the KDC and the target
were not using the KDC, the initiator would send its request for a key
to the KDC.&nbsp; The KDC would then initiate an external key management
exchange (e.g. ISAKMP) with a node that the target's KX record(s) pointed
to, on behalf of the initiator node.

<P>The target node could verify that the KDC were allowed to proxy for
the initiator node by looking up the KX records for the initiator node
and finding a KX record for the initiator that listed the KDC.

<P>Then the external key exchange would be performed between the KDC and
the target node.&nbsp; Then the KDC would distribute the resulting IPsec
Security Association to the initiator.&nbsp; Again, IPsec traffic itself
could travel directly between the initiator and the destination.
<H4>
<A NAME="2.2.2 Dial-Up Host Example"></A>2.2.2 Dial-Up Host Example</H4>
This example outlines a possible use of KX records with mobile hosts that
dial into the network via PPP and are dynamically assigned an IP address
and domain-name at dial-in time.

<P>Consider the situation where each mobile node is dynamically assigned
both a domain name and an IP address at the time that node dials into the
network.&nbsp; Let the policy require that each mobile node act as its
own Key Exchanger.&nbsp; In this case, it is important that dial-in nodes
use addresses from one or more well known IP subnets or address pools edicated
to dial-in access.&nbsp; If that is true, then no KX record or other action
is needed to ensure that each node will act as its own Key Exchanger because
lack of a KX record indicates that the node is
<BR>its own Key Exchanger.

<P>Consider the situation where the mobile node's domain name remains constant
but its IP address changes.&nbsp; Let the policy require that each mobile
node act as its own Key Exchanger.&nbsp; In this case, there might be operational
problems when another node attempts to perform a secure reverse DNS lookup
on the IP address to determine the corresponding domain name.&nbsp; The
authenticated DNS binding (in the form of a PTR record) between the mobile
node's currently assigned IP address and its permanent domain name will
need to be securely updated each time the node is assigned a new IP address.&nbsp;
There are no mechanisms for accomplishing this that are both IETF-standard
and widely deployed as of the time this note was written.&nbsp; Use of
Dynamic
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>DNS Update without authentication is a significant security risk and
hence is not recommended for this situation.

<A NAME="3. SYNTAX OF KX RECORD"></A>3. SYNTAX OF KX RECORD</H2>
A KX record has the DNS TYPE of "KX" and a numeric value of 36.&nbsp; A
KX record is a member of the Internet ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.&nbsp; Each
KX record is associated with a &lt;domain-name> entry in the DNS.&nbsp;
A KX record has the following textual syntax:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;domain-name>&nbsp; IN&nbsp; KX&nbsp; &lt;preference>
&lt;domain-name>

<P>For this description, let the &lt;domain-name> item to the left of the
"KX" string be called &lt;domain-name 1> and the &lt;domain-name> item
to the right of the "KX" string be called &lt;domain-name 2>.&nbsp; &lt;preference>
is a non-negative integer.

<P>Internet nodes about to initiate a key exchange with &lt;domain-name
1> should instead contact &lt;domain-name 2> to initiate the key exchange
for a security service between the initiator and &lt;domain-name 2>.&nbsp;
If more than one KX record exists for &lt;domain-name 1>, then the &lt;preference>
field is used to indicate preference among the systems delegated to.&nbsp;
Lower values are preferred over higher values.&nbsp; The &lt;domain-name
2> is authorised to provide key exchange services on behalf of &lt;domain-name
1>.&nbsp; The &lt;domain-name 2> MUST have a CNAME
<BR>record, an A record, or an AAAA record associated with it.

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>KX records MUST cause type A additional section processing for the

the DNS transaction supports IPv6, KX records MUST also cause type AAAA
additional section processing.

<P>The KX RDATA field MUST NOT be compressed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"></A>4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</H2>
KX records MUST always be signed using the method(s) defined by the DNS
Security extensions specified in [<A HREF="rfc2065.html">RFC2065</A>].&nbsp;
All unsigned KX records MUST be ignored because of the security vulnerability
caused by assuming that unsigned records are valid.&nbsp; All signed KX
records whose signatures do not correctly validate MUST be ignored because
of the potential security vulnerability in trusting an invalid KX record.

<P>KX records MUST be ignored by systems not implementing Secure DNS because
such systems have no mechanism to authenticate the KX record.

<P>If a node does not have a permanent DNS entry and some form of Dynamic
DNS Update is in use, then those dynamic DNS updates MUST be fully authenticated
to prevent an adversary from injecting false DNS records (especially the
KX, A, and PTR records) into the Domain Name System.&nbsp; If false records
were inserted into the DNS without being signed by the Secure DNS mechanisms,
then a denial-of-service attack results.&nbsp; If false records were inserted
into the DNS and were (erroneously) signed by the signing authority, then
an active attack results.

<P>Myriad serious security vulnerabilities can arise if the restrictions
throuhout this document are not strictly adhered to.&nbsp; Implementers
should carefully consider the openly published issues relating to DNS security
[Bell95,Vixie95] as they build their implementations. Readers should also
consider the security considerations discussed in the DNS Security Extensions
document [<A HREF="rfc2065.html">RFC2065</A>].
