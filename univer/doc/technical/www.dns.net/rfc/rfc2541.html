<a NAME="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
Secure DNS is based on cryptographic techniques.&nbsp; A necessary part
of the strength of these techniques is careful attention to the operational
aspects of key and signature generation, lifetime, size, and storage.&nbsp;
In addition, special attention must be paid to the security of the high
level zones, particularly the root zone.&nbsp; This document discusses
these operational aspects for keys and signatures used in connection with
the KEY and SIG DNS resource records.

<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
This document describes operational considerations for the generation,
lifetime, size, and storage of DNS cryptographic keys and signatures for
use in the KEY and SIG resource records [RFC 2535]. Particular attention
is paid to high level zones and the root zone.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. Public/Private Key Generation</h2>
Careful generation of all keys is a sometimes overlooked but absolutely
essential element in any cryptographically secure system. The strongest
algorithms used with the longest keys are still of no use if an adversary
can guess enough to lower the size of the likely key space so that it can
be exhaustively searched.&nbsp; Technical suggestions for the generation
of random keys will be found in [RFC 1750].
<p>Long term keys are particularly sensitive as they will represent a more
valuable target and be subject to attack for a longer time than short period
keys.&nbsp; It is strongly recommended that long term key generation occur
off-line in a manner isolated from the network via an air gap or, at a
minimum, high level secure hardware.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. Public/Private Key Lifetimes</h2>
No key should be used forever.&nbsp; The longer a key is in use, the greater
the probability that it will have been compromised through carelessness,
accident, espionage, or cryptanalysis.&nbsp; Furthermore, if key rollover
is a rare event, there is an increased risk that, when the time does come
to change the key, no one at the site will remember how to do it or operational
problems will have developed in the key rollover procedures.
<p>While public key lifetime is a matter of local policy, these considerations
imply that, unless there are extraordinary circumstances, no long term
key should have a lifetime significantly over four years.&nbsp; In fact,
a reasonable guideline for long term keys that are kept off-line and carefully
guarded is a 13 month lifetime with the intent that they be replaced every
year.&nbsp; A reasonable maximum lifetime for keys that are used for transaction
security or the like and are kept on line is 36 days with the intent that
they be replaced monthly or more often.&nbsp; In many cases, a key lifetime
of somewhat over a day may be reasonable.
<p>On the other hand, public keys with too short a lifetime can lead to
excessive resource consumption in re-signing data and retrieving fresh
information because cached information becomes stale.&nbsp; In the Internet
environment, almost all public keys should have lifetimes no shorter than
three minutes, which is a reasonable estimate of maximum packet delay even
in unusual circumstances.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Public/Private Key Size Considerations</h2>
There are a number of factors that effect public key size choice for use
in the DNS security extension.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these factors usually
do not all point in the same direction.&nbsp; Choice of zone key size should
generally be made by the zone administrator depending on their local conditions.
<p>For most schemes, larger keys are more secure but slower.&nbsp; In addition,
larger keys increase the size of the KEY and SIG RRs.&nbsp; This increases
the chance of DNS UDP packet overflow and the possible necessity for using
higher overhead TCP in responses.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.1"></a>4.1 RSA Key Sizes</h3>
Given a small public exponent, verification (the most common operation)
for the MD5/RSA algorithm will vary roughly with the square of the modulus
length, signing will vary with the cube of the modulus length, and key
generation (the least common operation) will vary with the fourth power
of the modulus length.&nbsp; The current best algorithms for factoring
a modulus and breaking RSA security vary roughly with the 1.6 power of
the modulus itself.&nbsp; Thus going from a 640 bit modulus to a 1280 bit
modulus only increases the verification time by a factor of 4 but may increase
the work factor of breaking the key by over 2^900.
<p>The recommended minimum RSA algorithm modulus size is 704 bits which
is believed by the author to be secure at this time.&nbsp; But high level
zones in the DNS tree may wish to set a higher minimum, perhaps 1000 bits,
for security reasons.&nbsp; (Since the United States National Security
Agency generally permits export of encryption systems using an RSA modulus
of up to 512 bits, use of that small a modulus, i.e. n, must be considered
weak.)
<p>For an RSA key used only to secure data and not to secure other keys,
704 bits should be adequate at this time.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.2"></a>4.2 DSS Key Sizes</h3>
DSS keys are probably roughly as strong as an RSA key of the same length
but DSS signatures are significantly smaller.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Private Key Storage</h2>
It is recommended that, where possible, zone private keys and the zone
file master copy be kept and used in off-line, non-network connected, physically
secure machines only.&nbsp; Periodically an application can be run to add
authentication to a zone by adding SIG and NXT RRs and adding no-key type
KEY RRs for subzones/algorithms where a real KEY RR for the subzone with
that algorithm is not provided. Then the augmented file can be transferred,
perhaps by sneaker-net, to the networked zone primary server machine.
<p>The idea is to have a one way information flow to the network to avoid
the possibility of tampering from the network.&nbsp; Keeping the zone master
file on-line on the network and simply cycling it through an off-line signer
does not do this.&nbsp; The on-line version could still be tampered with
if the host it resides on is compromised.&nbsp; For maximum security, the
master copy of the zone file should be off net and should not be updated
based on an unsecured network mediated communication.
<p>This is not possible if the zone is to be dynamically updated securely
[RFC 2137]. At least a private key capable of updating the SOA and NXT
chain must be on line in that case.
<p>Secure resolvers must be configured with some trusted on-line public
key information (or a secure path to such a resolver) or they will be unable
to authenticate.&nbsp; Although on line, this public key information must
be protected or it could be altered so that spoofed DNS data would appear
authentic.
<p>Non-zone private keys, such as host or user keys, generally have to
be kept on line to be used for real-time purposes such as DNS transaction
security.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="6"></a>6. High Level Zones, The Root Zone, and The Meta-Root Key</h2>
Higher level zones are generally more sensitive than lower level zones.&nbsp;
Anyone controlling or breaking the security of a zone thereby obtains authority
over all of its subdomains (except in the case of resolvers that have locally
configured the public key of a subdomain).&nbsp; Therefore, extra care
should be taken with high level zones and strong keys used.
<p>The root zone is the most critical of all zones.&nbsp; Someone controlling
or compromising the security of the root zone would control the entire
DNS name space of all resolvers using that root zone (except in the case
of resolvers that have locally configured the public key of a subdomain).
Therefore, the utmost care must be taken in the securing of the root zone.
The strongest and most carefully handled keys should be used.&nbsp; The
root zone private key should always be kept off line.
<p>Many resolvers will start at a root server for their access to and authentication
of DNS data.&nbsp; Securely updating an enormous population of resolvers
around the world will be extremely difficult.&nbsp; Yet the guidelines
in section 3 above would imply that the root zone private key be changed
annually or more often and if it were staticly configured at all these
resolvers, it would have to be updated when changed.
<p>To permit relatively frequent change to the root zone key yet minimize
exposure of the ultimate key of the DNS tree, there will be a "meta-root"
key used very rarely and then only to sign a sequence of regular root key
RRsets with overlapping time validity periods that are to be rolled out.
The root zone contains the meta-root and current regular root KEY RR(s)
signed by SIG RRs under both the meta-root and other root private key(s)
themselves.
<p>The utmost security in the storage and use of the meta-root key is essential.&nbsp;
The exact techniques are precautions to be used are beyond the scope of
this document.&nbsp; Because of its special position, it may be best to
continue with the same meta-root key for an extended period of time such
as ten to fifteen years.
