<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated distributed
database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and other information.
The DNS has been extended to include digital signatures and cryptographic
keys as described in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].&nbsp; Thus
the DNS can now be secured and can be used for secure key distribution.
<p>This document describes how to store US Government Digital Signature
Algorithm (DSA) keys and signatures in the DNS.&nbsp; Familiarity with
the US Digital Signature Algorithm is assumed [Schneier].&nbsp; Implementation
of DSA is mandatory for DNS security.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. DSA KEY Resource Records</h2>
DSA public keys are stored in the DNS as KEY RRs using algorithm number
3 [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].&nbsp; The structure of the algorithm
specific portion of the RDATA part of this RR is as shown below.&nbsp;
These fields, from Q through Y are the "public key" part of the DSA KEY
RR.
<p>The period of key validity is not in the KEY RR but is indicated by
the SIG RR(s) which signs and authenticates the KEY RR(s) at that domain
name.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Size</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1&nbsp; octet</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
20&nbsp; octets</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
64 + T*8&nbsp; octets</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
64 + T*8&nbsp; octets</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
64 + T*8&nbsp; octets</tt>
<p>As described in [FIPS 186] and [Schneier]: T is a key size parameter
chosen such that 0 &lt;= T &lt;= 8.&nbsp; (The meaning for algorithm 3
if the T octet is greater than 8 is reserved and the remainder of the RDATA
portion may have a different format in that case.)&nbsp; Q is a prime number
selected at key generation time such that 2**159 &lt; Q &lt; 2**160 so
Q is always 20 octets long and, as with all other fields, is stored in
"big-endian" network order.&nbsp; P, G, and Y are calculated as directed
by the FIPS 186 key generation algorithm [Schneier].&nbsp; P is in the
range 2**(511+64T) &lt; P &lt; 2**(512+64T) and so is 64 + 8*T octets long.&nbsp;
G and Y are quantities modulus P and so can be up to the same length as
P and are allocated fixed size fields with the same number of octets as
P.
<p>During the key generation process, a random number X must be generated
such that 1 &lt;= X &lt;= Q-1.&nbsp; X is the private key and is used in
the final step of public key generation where Y is computed as
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = G**X
mod P</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. DSA SIG Resource Records</h2>
The signature portion of the SIG RR RDATA area, when using the US Digital
Signature Algorithm, is shown below with fields in the order they occur.&nbsp;
See [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>] for fields in the SIG RR RDATA
which precede the signature itself.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Size</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1 octet</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
20 octets</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
20 octets</tt>
<p>The data signed is determined as specified in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC
2535</a>].&nbsp; Then the following steps are taken, as specified in [FIPS
186], where Q, P, G, and Y are as specified in the public key [Schneier]:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hash = SHA-1 ( data )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate a random K such
that 0 &lt; K &lt; Q.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R = ( G**K mod P ) mod Q
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S = ( K**(-1) * (hash + X*R)
) mod Q
<p>Since Q is 160 bits long, R and S can not be larger than 20 octets,
which is the space allocated.
<p>T is copied from the public key.&nbsp; It is not logically necessary
in the SIG but is present so that values of T > 8 can more conveniently
be used as an escape for extended versions of DSA or other algorithms as
later specified.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Performance Considerations</h2>
General signature generation speeds are roughly the same for RSA [<a href="rfc2537.html">RFC
2537</a>] and DSA.&nbsp; With sufficient pre-computation, signature generation
with DSA is faster than RSA.&nbsp; Key generation is also faster for DSA.
However, signature verification is an order of magnitude slower than RSA
when the RSA public exponent is chosen to be small as is recommended for
KEY RRs used in domain name system (DNS) data authentication.
<p>Current DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers, typically
less than 512 bytes including overhead.&nbsp; While larger transfers will
perform correctly and work is underway to make larger transfers more efficient,
it is still advisable at this time to make reasonable efforts to minimize
the size of KEY RR sets stored within the DNS consistent with adequate
security.&nbsp; Keep in mind that in a secure zone, at least one authenticating
SIG RR will also be returned.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Security Considerations</h2>
Many of the general security consideration in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC
2535</a>] apply.&nbsp; Keys retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted
unless (1) they have been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently
verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure obtainment
or independent verification conform to security policies acceptable to
the user.&nbsp; As with all cryptographic algorithms, evaluating the necessary
strength of the key is essential and dependent on local policy.
<p>The key size limitation of a maximum of 1024 bits ( T = 8 ) in the current
DSA standard may limit the security of DSA.&nbsp; For particularly critical
applications, implementors are encouraged to consider the range of available
algorithms and key sizes.
<p>DSA assumes the ability to frequently generate high quality random numbers.&nbsp;
See [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1750.txt">RFC 1750</a>] for guidance.&nbsp;
DSA is designed so that if manipulated rather than random numbers are used,
very high bandwidth covert channels are possible.&nbsp; See [Schneier]
and more recent research.&nbsp; The leakage of an entire DSA private key
in only two DSA signatures has been demonstrated.&nbsp; DSA provides security
only if trusted implementations, including trusted random number generation,
<br>are used.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="6"></a>6. IANA Considerations</h2>
Allocation of meaning to values of the T parameter that are not defined
herein requires an IETF standards actions.&nbsp; It is intended that values
unallocated herein be used to cover future extensions of the DSS standard.
