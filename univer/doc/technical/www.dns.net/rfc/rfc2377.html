Abstract</H2>
Application of the conventional X.500 approach to naming has heretofore,
in the experience of the authors, proven to be an obstacle to the wide
deployment of directory-enabled applications on the Internet.  We
propose a new directory naming plan that leverages the strengths of the
most popular and successful Internet naming schemes for naming objects
in a hierarchical directory.  This plan can, we believe, by extending
the X.500 approach to naming, facilitate the creation of an Internet White
Pages Service (IWPS) and other directory-enabled applications by overcoming
the problems encountered by those using the conventional X.500 approach.

<A NAME="1"></A>1.0 Executive Summary</H2>
Application of the conventional X.500 approach to naming has heretofore,
in the experience of the authors, proven to be an obstacle to the wide
deployment of directory-enabled applications on the Internet.  The
required registration infrastructure is either non-existent or largely
ignored.  The infrastructure that does exist is cumbersome to use
and tends to produce counterproductive results.  The attributes used for
naming have been confusing for users and inflexible to managers and operators
of directory servers.

<P>
This paper describes a directory naming plan for the construction of
an Internet directory infrastructure to support directory-enabled applications
that can serve as an alternative (or extension) to the conventional X.500
approach.

<P>
The plan has the following two main features.  First, it bases
the root and upper portions of the name hierarchy on the existing infrastructure
of names from the Domain Name System (DNS). This component of the plan
makes use of the ideas described in the companion paper to this plan, "Using
Domains in LDAP Distinguished Names" <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>.
And second, it provides a number of options for the assignment of names
to directory leaf objects such as person objects, including an option that
allows the reuse of existing Internet identifiers for people.

<P>
Just as the conventional X.500 style of naming is not a formal standard,
use of the naming plan described here is not obligatory for directory-enabled
applications on the Internet.  Other approaches are permissible.  However,
we believe widespread use of this plan will largely eliminate naming as
a typically thorny issue when administrators set up an LDAP-based directory
service.  Further, we strongly encourage developers of directory-enabled
products, especially LDAP clients and user interfaces, to assume that this
naming plan will see widespread use and design their products accordingly.

<P>
Here, in summary, is our proposal.

<P>
The upper portions of the hierarchical directory tree should be constructed
using the components of registered DNS names using the domain component
attribute "dc".  The directory name for the organization having the
domain name "acme.com" will then be, e.g.,

<P>
   dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
Organizations can add additional directory structure, for example to
support implementation of access control lists or partitioning of their
directory information, by using registered subdomains of DNS names, e.g.,
the subdomain "corporate.acme.com" can be used as the basis for the directory
name

<P>
   dc=corporate, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
For naming directory leaf objects such as persons, groups, server applications
and certification authorities in a hierarchical directory, we propose the
use of either the "uid" (user identifier) or the "cn" (common name) attribute
for the relative distinguished name.  This plan does not constrain how these
two attributes are used.

<P>
One approach to their use, for example, is to employ the uid attribute
as the RDN when reusing an existing store of identifiers and the cn attribute
as the RDN when creating new identifiers specifically for the directory.
A convenient existing identification scheme for person objects is the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mailbox identifier.  So an RDN for person employing this store of identifiers
would  be, e.g.,

<P>
   uid=John.Smith@acme.com

<P>
For leaf objects not conveniently identified with such a scheme, the
"cn" attribute is used, e.g.,

<P>
   cn=Reading Room

<P>
Directory distinguished names will thus have the following structure,
e.g.,

<P>
   uid=John.Smith@acme.com, dc=acme, dc=com
<BR>   uid=Mary.Jones@acme.com, dc=corporate, dc=acme, dc=com
<BR>   uid=J.Smith@worldnet.att.net, dc=legal, dc=acme, dc=com
<BR>   cn=Reading Room, dc=physics, dc=national-lab, dc=edu
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="2"></A>2.0 The Problem</H2>
The X.500 Directory model [2] can be used to create a world-wide distributed
directory.  The Internet X.500 Directory Pilot has been operational for
several years and has grown to a size of about 1.5 million entries of varying
quality.  The rate of growth of the pilot is far lower than the rate
of growth of the Internet during the pilot period.

<P>
There are a substantial number of contributing factors that have inhibited
the growth of this pilot.  The common X.500 approach to naming, while
not the preponderant problem, has contributed in several ways to limit
the growth of an Internet White Pages Service based on X.500.

<P>
The conventional way to construct names in the X.500 community is documented
as an informative (i.e., not officially standardized) Annex B to X.521.
The relative distinguished name (RDN) of a user consists of a common name
(cn) attribute.  This is meant to be what -- in the user's particular society
-- is customarily understood to be the name of that user.  The distinguished
name of a user is the combination of the name of some general object, such
as an organization or a geographical unit, with the common name.  There
are two main problems with this style of name construction.

<P>
First, the common name attribute, while seeming to be user-friendly,
cannot be used generally as an RDN in practice.  In any significant
set of users to be named under the same Directory Information Tree (DIT)
node there will be collisions on common name.  There is no way to
overcome this other than either by forcing uniqueness on common names,
something they do not possess, or by using an additional attribute to prevent
collisions.  This additional attribute normally needs to be unique
in a much larger context to have any practical value.  The end result
is a RDN that is very long and unpopular with users.

<P>
Second, and more serious, X.500 has not been able to use any significant
number of pre-existing names.  Since X.500 naming models typically
use organization names as part of the hierarchy [2, 3], organization names
must be registered.  As organization names are frequently tied to
trademarks and are used in sales and promotions, registration can be a
difficult and acrimonious process.

<P>
The North American Directory Forum (NADF, now the North Atlantic Directory
Forum but still the NADF) proposed to avoid the problem of registration
by using names that were already registered in the "civil naming infrastructure"<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1255.txt">[4]</A>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1417.txt">[5]</A>.  Directory distinguished
names would be based on an organization's legal name as recognized by some
governmental agency (county clerk, state secretary of state, etc.) or other
registering entity such as ANSI.

<P>
This scheme has the significant advantage of keeping directory service
providers out of disputes about the right to use a particular name, but
it leads to rather obscure names.  Among these obscurities, the legal
name almost invariably takes a form that is less familiar and longer than
what users typically associate with the organization.  For example, in the
US a large proportion of legal organization names end with the text ",
Inc." as in "Acme, Inc."  Moreover, in the case of the US, the civil
naming infrastructure does not operate nationally, so the organization
names it provides must be located under state and regional DIT nodes, making
them difficult to find while browsing the directory.  NADF proposes
a way to algorithmically
<BR>derive multi-attribute RDNs which would allow placement of entries
or aliases in more convenient places in the DIT, but these derived names
are cumbersome and unpopular.  For example, suppose Nadir is an organization
that is registered in New Jersey civil naming infrastructure under the
name "Nadir Networks, Inc."  Its civil distinguished name (DN) would
then be

<P>
   o="Nadir Networks, Inc.", st=New Jersey, c=US

<P>
while its derived name which is unambiguous under c=US directly is

<P>
   o="Nadir Networks, Inc." + st=New Jersey, c=US

<P>
More generally, the requirement for registration of organizations in
X.500 naming has led to the establishment of national registration authorities
whose function is mainly limited to assignment of X.500 organization names.
Because of the very limited attraction of X.500, interest in registering
an organization with one of these national authorities has been minimal.
Finally, multi-national organizations are frustrated by a lack of an international
registration authority.
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="3"></A>3.0 Requirements</H2>
A directory naming plan must provide a guide for the construction of names
(identifiers, labels) for directory objects that are unambiguous (identify
only one directory object) within some context (namespace), at a minimum
within one isolated directory server.

<P>
A directory object is simply a set of attribute values.  The association
between a real-world object and a directory object is made by directory-enabled
applications and is, in the general case, one to many.

<P>
The following additional naming characteristics are requirements that
this naming plan seeks to satisfy:

<P>
a) hierarchical

<P>
The Internet, consisting of a very large number of objects and management
domains, requires hierarchical names.  Such names permit delegation
in the name assignment process and partitioning of directory information
among directory servers.

<P>
b) friendly to loose coupling of directory servers

<P>
One purpose of this naming plan is to define a naming pattern that will
facilitate one form or another of loose coupling of potentially autonomous
directory servers into a larger system.

<P>
A name in such a loosely-coupled system should unambiguously identify
one real-world object.  The real-world object may, however, be represented
differently (i.e. by different directory objects having different attributes
but the same DN) in different (e.g. independently managed) servers in the
loosely-coupled system.  The plan does not attempt to produce names
to overcome this likely scenario.  That is, it does not attempt to
produce a single namespace for all directory objects. (This issue is considered
in more detail in Section 5.1.)

<P>
c) readily usable by LDAP clients and servers

<P>
As of this writing, a substantial number of the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1777.txt">[6]</A>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2251.txt">[7]</A> implementations are
currently available or soon will be.  The names specified by this
naming plan should be readily usable by these implementations and applications
based on them.

<P>
d) friendly to re-use of existing Internet name registries

<P>
As described in Section 2 above, creation of new global name registries
has been highly problematic.  Therefore, a fundamental requirement
this plan addresses is to enable the reuse of existing Internet name registries
such as DNS names and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mailbox identifiers when constructing directory names.

<P>
e) minimally user-friendly

<P>
Although we expect that user interfaces of directory-enabled applications
will avoid exposing users to DNs, it is unlikely that users can be totally
insulated from them.  For this reason, the naming plan should permit
use of familiar information in name construction.  Minimally, a user
should be capable of recognizing the information encoded in his/her own
DN.  Names that are totally opaque to users cannot meet this requirement.
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="4"></A>4.0 Name Construction</H2>
The paper assumes familiarity with the terminology and concepts behind
the terms distinguished name (DN) and relative distinguished name (RDN)
[2] <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1779.txt">[8]</A> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2253.txt">[9]</A>.

<P>
We describe how DNs can be constructed using three attribute types,
domainComponent (dc), userID (uid) and commonName (cn).  They are
each described in turn.
<BR>
<H3>
<A NAME="4.1"></A>4.1 Domain Component (dc)</H3>
The domain component attribute is defined and registered in RFC1274 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1274.txt">[3]</A>[10].
It is used in the construction of a DN from a domain name.  Details of the
construction algorithm is described in "Using Domains in LDAP Distinguished
Names" <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>.

<P>
An organization wishing to deploy a directory following this naming
plan would proceed as follows.  Consider an organization, for example
"Acme, Inc.", having the registered domain name "acme.com".  It would
construct the DN

<P>
   dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
from its domain name.  It would then use this DN as the root of
its subtree of directory information.

<P>
The DN itself can be used to identify a directory organization object
that represents information about the organization.  The directory schema
required to enable this is described below in section 5.2.

<P>
The subordinates of the DN will be directory objects related to the
organization.  The domain component attribute can be used to name
subdivisions of the organization such as organizational units and localities.
Acme, for example, might use the domain names "corporate.acme.com" and
"richmond.acme.com" to construct the names

<P>
   dc=corporate, dc=acme, dc=com
<BR>   dc=richmond, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
under which to place its directory objects.  The directory schema
required to name organizationalUnit and locality objects in this way is
described below in section 5.2.

<P>
Note that subdivisions of the organization such as organizational units
and localities could also be assigned RDNs using the conventional X.500
naming attributes, e.g.

<P>
   ou=corporate, dc=acme, dc=com
<BR>   l=richmond, dc=acme, dc=com.

<P>
Use of the dc attribute for the RDN of directory objects of class "domain"
is also possible <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>.
<BR>
<H3>
<A NAME="4.2"></A>4.2 User ID (uid)</H3>
The userid (uid) attribute is defined and registered in RFC1274 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1274.txt">[3]</A>[10].

<P>
This attribute may be used to construct the RDN for directory objects
subordinate to objects named according to the procedure described in Section
4.1.  This plan does not constrain how this attribute is used.
<BR>
<H3>
<A NAME="4.3"></A>4.3 Common Name (cn)</H3>
The commonName (cn) attribute is defined and registered in X.500 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1274.txt">[3]</A>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2256.txt">[11]</A>.

<P>
This attribute may be used to construct the RDN for directory objects
subordinate to objects named according to the procedure described in Section
4.1.  This plan does not constrain how this attribute is used.
<BR>
<H3>
<A NAME="4.4"></A>4.4 Examples of uid and cn Usage</H3>
Although this plan places no constraints on the use of the uid and cn attributes
for name construction, we would like to offer some suggestions by way of
examples.

<P>
In practice, we have used uid for the RDN for person objects were we
could make use of an existing registry of names and cn for other objects.

<P>
Examples of existing registries of identifiers for person objects are
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A> mailbox identifiers,
employee numbers and employee "handles". Aside from the convenience to
administrators of re-use of an existing store of identifiers, if it is
ever necessary to display to a user his/her DN, there is some hope that
it will be recognizable when such identifiers are used.

<P>
We have found <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mailbox identifiers a particularly convenient source for name construction.
When a person has several e-mail addresses, one will be selected for the
purpose of user identification.  We call this the "distinguished"
e-mail address or the "distinguished" <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mailbox identifier for the user.

<P>
For example, if there is a user affiliated with the organization Acme
having distinguished e-mail address J.Smith@acme.com, the uid attribute
will be:

<P>
   uid=J.Smith@acme.com

<P>
The domain component attributes of a user's DN will normally be constructed
from the domain name of his/her distinguished e-mail address.  That
is, for the user uid=J.Smith@acme.com the domain component attributes would
typically be:

<P>
   dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
The full LDAP DN for this user would then be:

<P>
   uid=J.Smith@acme.com, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
Directory administrators having several <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
identifiers to choose from when constructing a DN for a user should consider
the following factors:
<UL>
<LI>
Machine-independent addresses are likely to be more stable, resulting in
directory names that change less.  Thus an identifier such as:</LI>
</UL>

js@acme.com
<BLOCKQUOTE>may well be preferable to one such as:</BLOCKQUOTE>

js@blaster.third-floor.acme.com.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
Use of some form of "handle" for the "local" part that is  distinct
from a user's real name may result in fewer collisions and thereby lessen
user pain and suffering.  Thus the identifier:</LI>
</UL>

js@acme.com
<BLOCKQUOTE>may well be preferable to one such as:</BLOCKQUOTE>

J.Smith@acme.com

<P>
Practical experience with use of the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mailbox identifier scheme described here has shown that there are situations
where it is convenient to use such identifies for all users in a particular
population, although a few users do not, in fact, possess working mailboxes.
For example, an organization may have a existing unique identification
scheme for all employees that is used as a alias to the employees' real
mailboxes -- which may be quite heterogeneous in structure.  The identification
scheme works for all employees to identify unambiguously each employee;
it only works as an e-mail alias for those employees having real mailboxes.
For this reason it would be a bad assumption for directory-enabled applications
to assume the uid to be a valid mailbox; the value(s) of the mail attribute
should always be checked.

<P>
It is important to emphasize that the elements of the domain name of
an <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A> identifier may,
BUT NEED NOT, be the same as the domain components of the DN.  This
means that the domain components provide a degree of freedom to support
access control or other directory structuring requirements that need not
be mechanically reflected in the user's e-mail address.  We do not
want under any condition to force the user's e-mail address to change just
to facilitate a new system requirement such as a modification in an access
control structure.  It should also be noted that while we do not require
that the domain components match the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
identifier, we DO require that the concatenated domain components form
a registered domain name, that is, one that is represented in the DNS.
This automatically avoids name conflicts in the directory hierarchy.

<P>
To provide an example of a DN which deviates from what might be considered
the default structure, consider the following scenario.

<P>
Suppose that J.Smith needs to be granted special permissions to information
in the dc=acme, dc=com part of the LDAP DIT.  Since it will be, in
general, easier to organize special users by their name structure than
via groups (an arbitrary collection of DNs), we use subdomains for this
purpose.  Suppose the special permissions were required by users in
the MIS organizational unit.  A subdomain "mis.acme.com" is established,
if it does not already exist, according to normal DNS procedures.
The special permissions will be granted to users with the name structure:

<P>
   uid=*, dc=mis, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
The DN of J.Smith in this case will be:

<P>
   uid=J.Smith@acme.com, dc=mis, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
In principal, there is nothing to prevent the domain name elements of
the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A> identifier from
being completely different from the domain components of the DN.
For instance, the DN for a J.Smith could be:

<P>
   uid=J.Smith@worldnet.att.net, dc=mis, dc=acme, dc=com

<P>
While we do not REQUIRE that the domain name part of the uid match the
dc components of the directory distinguished name, we suggest that this
be done where possible.  At a minimum, if the most significant pieces of
the DN and the uid are the same (i.e., "dc=acme, dc=com" and "acme.com")
the likelihood, based on a knowledge of a user's e-mail address, of discovering
an appropriate directory system to contact to find information about the
user is greatly enhanced.

<P>
The example above represents a situation where this suggestion isn't
possible because some of the users in a population have mailbox identifiers
that differ from the pattern of the rest of the users, e.g., most mailboxes
are of the form local@acme.com, but a subpopulation have mailboxes from
an ISP and therefore mailboxes of the form local@worldnet.att.net.
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="5"></A>5.0 Naming Plan and Directories</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="5.1"></A>5.1 Directory Services Considerations</H3>
We envision the deployment of LDAP-based directory services on the Internet
to take the form of loosely coupled LDAP servers.  This coupling will occur
at two levels.

<P>
Firstly, LDAP servers will be loosely connected into islands (i.e. a
set of servers sharing a single DN namespace). The glue connecting the
islands will be LDAP referral [12] information configured into the LDAP
servers.  An LDAP search directed to any server in such an island can be
answered, if the information is not available to that server, by an LDAP
referral to another, more appropriate server within the same island.

<P>
Secondly, various techniques will be used span LDAP islands.  The concept
that enables such techniques is the LDAP URL <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2255.txt">[13]</A>.
By combining a DNS host name and port (corresponding to one or more LDAP
servers) with a DN, the LDAP URL provides unified high-level identification
scheme (an LDAP URL namespace) for directory objects.

<P>
Because an LDAP referral is expressed as one or more LDAP URL, these
two levels of coupling may not sharply distinguished in practice.

<P>
We do not envision the X.500 model of a single DIT (i.e. a single DN
namespace) to be viable in an environment of competing service providers.
This naming plan does not attempt to produce DNs to hide the possibility
that a given real-world object may have independently managed directory
objects with the same DN associated with it.
<BR>
<H3>
<A NAME="5.2"></A>5.2 Directory Schema Implications of the Naming Plan</H3>


<P>
<BR>The traditional directory schema(s) developed for the X.500 standard
and its application to the Internet <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1255.txt">[4]</A>
require extension to be used with the naming plan developed here.  The extensions
described below attempt to reuse existing schema elements as much as possible.
The directory objects for which extensions are required are: organization,
organizational unit, and various classes of leaf objects.  We describe the
schema modifications below for organization, organizationalUnit and selected
leaf classes.

<P>
So as to continue to use existing structural object classes to the extent
possible, we propose supplementing entries based on these classes with
additional information from two new auxiliary object classes, dcObject
and uidObject.  They are specified using the notation in Section 4 of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2252.txt">[14]</A>.

<P>
The auxiliary object class dcObject is defined in "Using Domains in
LDAP Distinguished Names" <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>.

<P>
The auxiliary object class uidObject is defined as:

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.3.1
<BR>  NAME uidObject
<BR>  SUP top
<BR>  AUXILIARY
<BR>  MUST uid )
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.1"></A>5.2.1 Organization Schema</H4>
The dc attribute is employed to construct the RDN of an organization object.
This is enabled by adding the auxiliary class dcObject to the organization's
objectClass attribute.
<BR>
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.2"></A>5.2.2 Organizational Unit Schema</H4>
The dc attribute is employed to construct the RDN of an organizationalUnit
object (which is subordinate in the DIT to either an organization or an
organizationalUnit object).  This is enabled by adding the auxiliary
class dcObject to the organizational unit's objectClass attribute.
<BR>
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.3"></A>5.2.3 Person Schema</H4>
No schema extensions are required for person objects if either the inetOrgPerson
[15] (preferred) or the newPilotPerson object classes are used.  The attribute
uid is permissible in each class.  For consistency, the uidObject could
be added to person entry objectClass attributes to assist applications
filtering on this object class attribute value.  Use of other classes for
person objects with RDN constructed with the uid attribute such as organizationalPerson
requires the use of the uidObject class.

<P>
It has been traditional in X.500 and LDAP directory services to employ
the common name (cn) attribute in naming.  While this naming plan
doesn't require use of the cn attribute in naming, it should be stressed
that it is a required attribute in any class derived from the person class
and is still quite important.  It will play a significant role in
enabling searches to find user entries of
<BR>interest.
<BR>
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.4"></A>5.2.4 Certification Authority Schema</H4>
The certification authority (CA) object class is an auxiliary class, meaning
it is essentially a set of additional attributes for a base class such
as organizationalRole, organization, organizationalUnit or person.
Except in the case where the base structural class is inetOrgPerson, use
of the uid attribute to construct the RDN of a CA will require the auxiliary
class uidObject to permit the uid attribute to be used.  In the cases where
organizationalUnit or organization is the base class for a CA, use of the
auxiliary class dcObject will permit the RDN of the CA to be a domain component.
<BR>
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.5"></A>5.2.5 Server and Server Application Schema</H4>
Servers and server applications are typically represented, for want of
anything better, by entries of the object class applicationProcess (or
a class derived from it).  Sometimes the class applicationEntity is
used.  In either case, the uid attribute should probably not be employed
to construct the RDN of a server or server application object.  The
standard schema uses the attribute cn for such RDNs.

<P>
Suppose one wants to use this naming plan both in the construction of
DNs for SSL server certificates and for their storage in a directory.  It
is customary for clients connecting via SSL to compare the server's domain
name (e.g. from the URL used to contact the server) with the value of the
cn attribute in the subject field (i.e. subject's DN) of the server's certificate.
For this reason, it is common practice to set the cn attribute to the server's
domain name.

<P>
The naming and schema to handle this situation is best explained by
an example.  Consider the server "host.acme.com". Following the algorithm
in "Using Domains in LDAP Distinguished Names" <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>,
the DN dc=host, dc=acme, dc=com is constructed.  To conform to the existing
practices just described, the server's subject DN for the SSL server certificate
should be cn=host.acme.com, dc=host, dc=acme, dc=com and the server's certificate
should be stored in a directory entry with this name.  This entry should
use application process or application entity as its structural object
class and strong authentication user as is auxiliary class.
<BR>
<H4>
<A NAME="5.2.6"></A>5.2.6 Name Forms</H4>
For X.500 servers or LDAP servers following the X.500 model, our schema
requires the definition of new name forms, structure rules, and DIT content
rules.  Structure rules and DIT content rules are locally defined,
and do not involve a globally significant object identifier.

<P>
The following name forms are defined using the syntax of section 6.22
of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2252.txt">[14]</A> for the convenience
of those using such servers.

<P>
Note that since the structural object classes organization, organizationalUnit,
locality and organizationalPerson do not permit inclusion of the dc attribute,
an auxiliary object class such as dcObject <A HREF="rfc2247.html">[1]</A>
must be used for instances of these classes.)

<P>
<A NAME="5.2.6.1"></A>5.2.6.1 Name Form for Domain Objects

<P>
The OIDs in this group are under the iso.org.dod.internet.directory.NameForm
branch of the OID tree (1.3.6.1.1.2).

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.2.1
<BR>  NAME domainNameForm
<BR>  OC domain
<BR>  MUST dc )

<P>
The domainNameForm name form indicates that objects of structural object
class domain have their RDN constructed from a value of the attribute dc.

<P>
<A NAME="5.2.6.2"></A>5.2.6.2 Name Form for Organization Objects

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.2.2
<BR>  NAME dcOrganizationNameForm
<BR>  OC organization
<BR>  MUST dc )

<P>
The dcOrganizationNameForm name form indicates that objects of structural
object class organization have their RDN constructed from a value of the
attribute dc.

<P>
<A NAME="5.2.6.3"></A>5.2.6.3 Name Form for Organizational Unit Objects

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.2.3
<BR>  NAME dcOrganizationalUnitNameForm
<BR>  OC organizationalUnit
<BR>  MUST dc )

<P>
The dcOrganizationalUnitNameForm name form indicates that objects of
structural object class organizationalUnit have their RDN constructed from
a value of the attribute dc.

<P>
<A NAME="5.2.6.4"></A>5.2.6.4 Name Form for Locality Objects

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.2.4
<BR>  NAME dcLocalityNameForm
<BR>  OC locality
<BR>  MUST dc )

<P>
The dcLocalityNameForm name form indicates that objects of structural
object class locality have their RDN constructed from a value of the attribute
dc.

<P>
<A NAME="5.2.6.5"></A>5.2.6.5 Name Form for Organizational Person Objects

<P>
( 1.3.6.1.1.2.5
<BR>  NAME uidOrganizationalPersonNameForm
<BR>  OC organizationalPerson
<BR>  MUST uid )

<P>
The uidOrganizationalPersonNameForm name form indicates that objects
of structural object class organizationalPerson have their RDN constructed
from a value of the attribute uid.

<A NAME="6"></A>6.0 Security Considerations</H2>
Although access controls may be placed on portions of the DIT to deny browse
access to unauthorized clients, it may be possible to infer directory names
and DIT structure in such sensitive portions of the DIT from the results
of DNS queries.  Providing public visibility to some portions of the DIT
may assist those make such inferences.
