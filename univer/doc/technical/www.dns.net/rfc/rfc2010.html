<A NAME="1"></A>1 - Rationale and Scope</H2>
1.1. Historically, the name servers responsible for the root (".") zone
have also been responsible for all international top-level domains (iTLD's,
for example: COM, EDU, INT, ARPA).  These name servers have been operated
by a cadre of highly  capable volunteers, and their administration
has been loosely coordinated by the NIC (first SRI-NIC and now InterNIC).
Ultimate responsibility for the correct operation of these servers and
for the content of the DNS zones they served has always rested with the
IANA.

<P>
1.2. As described in [Postel96], many new TLD's may be created shortly.
Servers for all new and existing iTLD's will be subject to the operational
requirements given in [Postel96].  The set of servers for the root
(".")  zone is likely to become disjoint from the set of servers for
any TLD or group of TLD's, including those maintained by the InterNIC.

<P>
1.3. In spite of the similarities in operational requirements between
the servers for the iTLD's and the servers for the root (".") zone, they
are in fact different server sets with different administrators and slightly
different operational requirements.  It is likely that many contry code
tld servers will have even more divergent operational requirements.  That
said, the requirements set down in this document could be successfully
applied to any name server (whether root, top level, or any other level),
but may be more draconian than necessary for servers other than those of
the root (".") zone.
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Disclaimer:</TD>

<TD>The selection of name server locations and administrators, and the
procedures for addressing noncompliance with these stated operational requirements,
are outside the scope of this document.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Definition:</TD>

<TD>For the purpose of this document, the term "zone master" shall be used
to designate the administrative owner of the content of a zone.  This
person is expected to have final responsibility for the selection and correct
operation of all of the zone's servers.  For the root (".") zone,
this is the IANA.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>
<A NAME="2"></A>2 - Operational Requirements</H2>
<A NAME="2.1"></A>2.1. Name server software.  The zone master shall
initially and periodically choose a name server package to run on all of
the zone's servers.  It is expected that the BIND server will be used,
at least initially, and that new versions or other servers will be specified
from time to time.
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>This requirement is based on the wide and free availability of BIND's
source code, and the active analysis and development it constantly receives
from several members of the IETF.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
Name server software upgrades will be specified and scheduled by the
zone master, and must occur on all of a zone's servers within a specified
96 hour window.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>In some cases it has proven necessary to "cold start" a zone's servers
in order to clear out oscillating bad data.  By forcing all software
upgrades to happen at about the same time, it will be possible to coordinate
a software change with a zone content change.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.2"></A>2.2. UDP checksums.  UDP checksums must be generated
when sending datagrams, and verified when receiving them.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Some vendors turn off UDP checksums for performance reasons, citing
the presence of MAC-level frame checks (CRC, for example) as "strong enough."
This has been a disaster in actual practice.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.3"></A>2.3. Dedicated host.  A name server host should
have no other function, and no login accounts other than for system or
network administrators.  No other network protocols should be served
by a name server host (e.g., SMTP, NNTP, FTP, et al).  If login is
permitted from other than the system console, then the login service must
be by encrypted channel (e.g., Kerberized and encrypted rlogin/telnet,
the secure shell (SSH), or an equivilent).
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Each additional service performed by a host makes it less reliable
and potentially less secure, as well as complicating fault isolation procedures.
While name service does not consume very much in the way of system resources,
it is thought best that a host do a few things well rather than many things
poorly.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.4"></A>2.4. Clock synchronization.  A name server host
should synchronize its clock using the NTP protocol (currnet version) with
authentication.  At least two NTP servers should be used.  As
an exception to section 2.3 above, a name server host can be an NTP server
as well.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>For distributed fault isolation reasons, synchronized time stamps in
system event logs are quite helpful.  NTP is easily spoofed by UDP blast
attacks, thus the requirement for authentication between the name server
host and its NTP servers.  A name server host is allowed to be an
NTP server because it has been observed that a single host running both
name service and stratum 1 NTP is still quite reliable and secure.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.5"></A>2.5. Network interfaces.  Name servers must send
UDP responses with an IP source address (and UDP source port number) equal
to the IP destination address (and UDP destination port number) of the
request.  Also, a name server might have multiple real interfaces, but only
one will be advertised in the zone's NS RRset and associated glue A RRs.
The advertised address should be that of the "best" interface on the host,
in terms of network performance and reliability to the largest number of
destinations.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>While not required by [<A HREF="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC1035</A>],
many extant DNS implementations require the source address and port of
a reply to match the destination address and port to which the request
was sent.  The number of advertised addresses is limited to one (1)
so that DNS delegation responses containing this name server can be as
short as possible.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.6"></A>2.6. Physical environment.  A name server host
must be located in a secure space such as a locked computer room or a data
center with restricted access.  The power supply should be redundant,
using batteries, generators or some other means to protect against utility
power failures.  Network connectivity should be redundant, so that
a single wide area line failure cannot completely isolate the name server
host from the rest of the network.

<P>
<A NAME="2.7"></A>2.7. Network security.  The system and network
administrators should educate themselves about potential threats, and stay
current on CERT bulletins regarding network breakins.  The system
staff should periodically audit the name server host's activity logs and
be able to detect breakins during or after the fact.

<P>
<A NAME="2.8"></A>2.8. Host performance.  As of the time of this
writing, a name server must be able to answer 1,200 UDP transactions per
second with less than 5 milliseconds of average latency.  Because
the network is still growing at a high rate, the ability to grow to 2,000
transactions per second and still support a 5 millisecond latency is highly
desirable.  Note that this requirement affects both the host and the network
infrastructure to which that host is attached.

<P>
<A NAME="2.9"></A>2.9. Response time.  The administrators responsible
for a name server will respond to e-mail trouble reports within 24 hours.
Personnel issues such as vacations and illness will cause responsibilities
to be delegated and/or reassigned rather than ignored.  After hours
telephone numbers must be made available to the zone master for nonpublished
use in emergencies.  An escalation contact name, e-mail address, and
telephone number will also be made available to the zone master in the
event of nonresponse through the normal channel.

<P>
<A NAME="2.10"></A>2.10. Zone transfer access control.  The name
server shall be configured so that outbound zone transfers are permitted
only to destinations on the server's local networks, and to whichever networks
the zone master designates for remote debugging purposes.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Zone transfers can present a significant load on a name server, especially
if several transfers are started simultaneously against the same server.
There is no operational reason to allow anyone outside the name server's
and zone's administrators to transfer the entire zone.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.11"></A>2.11. Zone transfer protocol.  DNS AXFR shall
be used in preference to FTP or any other non-DNS transfer protocol.
DNS NOTIFY (see [<A HREF="rfc1996.html">NOTIFY</A>]) and DNS IXFR (see
[<A HREF="rfc1995.html">IXFR</A>]) shall be supported and enabled when
available.
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Historically, the common implementations of DNS (a.k.a., BIND) did
not support zone transfer of the root (".") zone due to programming errors.
Thus, FTP was used.  In the future, DNS implementations which do not
support zone transfer of all zones will not be considered suitable for
use as root name servers.  The benefits of [<A HREF="rfc1995.html">IXFR</A>]
and <A HREF="rfc1996.html">[NOTIFY</A>] should be obvious.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.12"></A>2.12. Recursion shall be disabled for queries.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Recursion is a major source of cache pollution, and can be a major
drain on name server performance.  An organization's recursive DNS
needs should be served by some other host than its root name server(s).
An exception is made for missing glue since it's possible that glue needed
for some delegations will not be within or beneath any zone for which the
server is authoritative.  Such glue must be fetched via recursive
lookups to other servers.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<A NAME="2.13"></A>2.13. Outages shall be reported.  All outages,
scheduled or not, shall be reported to the zone master via e-mail.
If an outage is unscheduled or if an outage is scheduled less than 24 hours
in advance, then an additional notification of the zone master shall be
made via telephone.  Extended or repeated outages may beget special
handling by the zone master.

<P>
<A NAME="2.14"></A>2.14. Inverse name lookups.  The PTR RR associated
with a server's primary interface address (that is, the address shown in
in the zone's delegation) shall have its target specified by the zone master.
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Rationale:</TD>

<TD>Since each organization has local control of their network's PTR RRs,
and since it is necessary for the correct operation of some software that
the forward and reverse lookups have symmetrical results, it is left up
to the zone master to select the name for each authority server's primary
address.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>
<A NAME="3"></A>3 - Possible Selection Criteria</H2>
<A NAME="3.1"></A>3.1. Host population.  A server's location on the
network should be such that it has a low IP hop count to a high number
of end hosts.  Duplication of service should be avoided, such that any given
set of end hosts needs to have a low IP hop count to at most one authority
server for any given zone.

<P>
<A NAME="3.2"></A>3.2. Infrastructure diversity.  A server's location
on the network should be such that most failures capable of isolating it
from a large number of end hosts are diverse from the failures capable
of similarly isolating other authority servers for the same zone(s).
