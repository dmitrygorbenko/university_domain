<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
Dynamic update operations have been defined for the Domain Name System
(DNS) in <a href="rfc2136.html">RFC 2136</a>, but without a detailed description
of security for those updates.&nbsp; Means of securing the DNS and using
it for key distribution have been defined in <a href="rfc2065.html">RFC
2065</a>.
<p>This memo proposes techniques based on the defined DNS security mechanisms
to authenticate DNS updates.
<p>Familiarity with the DNS system [RFC <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">1034</a>,
<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">1035</a>]
is assumed. Familiarity with the DNS security and dynamic update proposals
will be helpful.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="1.1"></a>1.1 Overview of DNS Dynamic Update</h3>
DNS dynamic update defines a new DNS opcode, new DNS request and response
structure if that opcode is used, and new error codes.&nbsp; An update
can specify complex combinations of deletion and insertion (with or without
pre-existence testing) of resource records (RRs) with one or more owner
names; however, all testing and changes for any particular DNS update request
are restricted to a single zone. Updates occur at the primary server for
a zone.
<p>The primary server for a secure dynamic zone must increment the zone
SOA serial number when an update occurs or the next time the SOA is retrieved
if one or more updates have occurred since the previous SOA retrieval and
the updates themselves did not update the SOA.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="1.2"></a>1.2 Overview of DNS Security</h3>
DNS security authenticates data in the DNS by also storing digital signatures
in the DNS as SIG resource records (RRs).&nbsp; A SIG RR provides a digital
signature on the set of all RRs with the same owner name and class as the
SIG and whose type is the type covered by the SIG.&nbsp; The SIG RR cryptographically
binds the covered RR set to the signer, time signed, signature expiration
date, etc.&nbsp; There are one or more keys associated with every secure
zone and all data in the secure zone is signed either by a zone key or
by a dynamic update key tracing its authority to a zone key.
<p>DNS security also defines transaction SIGs and request SIGs. Transaction
SIGs appear at the end of a response.&nbsp; Transaction SIGs authenticate
the response and bind it to the corresponding request with the key of the
host where the responding DNS server is.&nbsp; Request SIGs appear at the
end of a request and authenticate the request with the key of the submitting
entity.
<p>Request SIGs are the primary means of authenticating update requests.
<p>DNS security also permits the storage of public keys in the DNS via
KEY RRs.&nbsp; These KEY RRs are also, of course, authenticated by SIG
RRs.&nbsp; KEY RRs for zones are stored in their superzone and subzone
servers, if any, so that the secure DNS tree of zones can be traversed
by a security aware resolver.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. Two Basic Modes</h2>
A dynamic secure zone is any secure DNS zone containing one or more KEY
RRs that can authorize dynamic updates, i.e., entity or user KEY RRs with
the signatory field non-zero, and whose zone KEY RR signatory field indicates
that updates are implemented. There are two basic modes of dynamic secure
zone which relate to the update strategy, mode A and mode B.&nbsp; A summary
comparison table is given below and then each mode is described.

|&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes</tt>
<br><tt>-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------</tt>
<p>For mode A, the zone owner key and static zone master file are always
kept off-line for maximum security of the static zone contents.
<p>As a consequence, any dynamicly added or changed RRs are signed in the
secure zone by their authorizing dynamic update key and they are backed
up, along with this SIG RR, in a separate online dynamic master file.&nbsp;
In this type of zone, server computation is minimized since the server
need only check signatures on the update data and request, which have already
been signed by the updater, generally a much faster operation than signing
data.&nbsp; However, the AXFR SIG and NXT RRs which covers the zone under
the zone key will not cover dynamically added data.&nbsp; Thus, for type
A dynamic secure zones, zone transfer security is not automatically provided
for dynamically added RRs, where they could be omitted, and authentication
is not provided for the server denial of the existence of a dynamically
added type. Because the dynamicly added RRs retain their update KEY signed
SIG, finer grained control of updates can be implemented via bits in the
KEY RR signatory field.&nbsp; Because dynamic data is only stored in the
online dynamic master file and only authenticated by dynamic keys which
expire, updates are transient in nature.&nbsp; Key rollover for an entity
that can authorize dynamic updates is more cumbersome since the authority
of their key must be traceable to a zone key and so, in general, they must
securely communicate a new key to the zone authority for manual transfer
to the off line static master file. NOTE: for this mode the zone SOA must
be signed by a dynamic update key and that private key must be kept on
line so that the SOA can be changed for updates.
<p>For mode B, the zone owner key and master file are kept on-line at the
zone primary server. When authenticated updates succeed, SIGs under the
zone key for the resulting data (including the possible NXT type bit map
changes) are calculated and these SIG (and possible NXT) changes are entered
into the zone and the unified on-line master file.&nbsp; (The zone transfer
AXFR SIG may be recalculated for each update or on demand when a zone transfer
is requested and it is out of date.)
<p>As a consequence, this mode requires considerably more computational
effort on the part of the server as the public/private keys are generally
arranged so that signing (calculating a SIG) is more effort than verifying
a signature.&nbsp; The security of static data in the zone is decreased
because the ultimate state of the static data being served and the ultimate
zone authority private key are all on-line on the net.&nbsp; This means
that if the primary server is subverted, false data could be authenticated
to secondaries and other servers/resolvers.&nbsp; On the other hand, this
mode of operation means that data added dynamically is more secure than
in mode A.&nbsp; Dynamic data will be covered by the AXFR SIG and thus
always protected during zone transfers and will be included in NXT RRs
so that it can be falsely denied by a server only to the same extent that
static data can (i.e., if it is within a wild card scope). Because the
zone key is used to sign all the zone data, the information as to who originated
the current state of dynamic RR sets is lost, making unavailable the effects
of some of the update control bits in the KEY RR signatory field.&nbsp;
In addition, the incorporation of the updates into the primary master file
and their authentication by the zone key makes then permanent in nature.&nbsp;
Maintaining the zone key on-line also means that dynamic update keys which
are signed by the zone key can be dynamically updated since the zone key
is available to dynamically sign new values.
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; The Mode A / Mode B distinction only effects the validation
and performance of update requests.&nbsp; It has no effect on retrievals.
One reasonable operational scheme may be to keep a mostly static main zone
operating in Mode A and have one or more dynamic subzones operating in
Mode B.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. Keys</h2>
Dynamic update requests depend on update keys as described in section <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>
below.&nbsp; In addition, the zone secure dynamic update mode and availability
of some options is indicated in the zone key.&nbsp; Finally, a special
rule is used in searching for KEYs to validate updates as described in
section <a href="#3.3">3.3</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.1"></a>3.1 Update Keys</h3>
All update requests to a secure zone must include signatures by one or
more key(s) that together can authorize that update.&nbsp; In order for
the Domain Name System (DNS) server receiving the request to confirm this,
the key or keys must be available to and authenticated by that server as
a specially flagged KEY Resource Record.
<p>The scope of authority of such keys is indicated by their KEY RR owner
name, class, and signatory field flags as described below. In addition,
such KEY RRs must be entity or user keys and not have the authentication
use prohibited bit on.&nbsp; All parts of the actual update must be within
the scope of at least one of the keys used for a request SIG on the update
request as described in section 4.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="3.1.1"></a>3.1.1 Update Key Name Scope</h4>
The owner name of any update authorizing KEY RR must (1) be the same as
the owner name of any RRs being added or deleted or (2) a wildcard name
including within its extended scope (see section <a href="#3.3">3.3</a>)
the name of any RRs being added or deleted and those RRs must be in the
same
<br>zone.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="3.1.2"></a>3.1.2 Update Key Class Scope</h4>
The class of any update authorizing KEY RR must be the same as the class
of any RR's being added or deleted.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="3.1.3"></a>3.1.3 Update Key Signatory Field</h4>
The four bit "signatory field" (see <a href="rfc2065.html">RFC 2065</a>)
of any update authorizing KEY RR must be non-zero.&nbsp; The bits have
the meanings described below for non-zone keys (see section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>
for zone type keys).
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><tt>|&nbsp;&nbsp; zone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; strong&nbsp;&nbsp;
|&nbsp; unique&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; general&nbsp; |</tt>
<br><tt>+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+</tt>
<p>Bit 0, zone control - If nonzero, this key is authorized to attach,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detach, and move zones by creating and deleting
NS, glue A, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zone KEY RR(s).&nbsp; If zero, the key can
not authorize any update
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that would effect such RRs.&nbsp; This bit
is meaningful for both
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type A and type B dynamic secure zones.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; do not confuse the "zone" signatory
field bit with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "zone" key type bit.
<p>Bit 1, strong update - If nonzero, this key is authorized to add and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete RRs even if there are other RRs with
the same owner name
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and class that are authenticated by a SIG
signed with a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different dynamic update KEY. If zero, the
key can only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authorize updates where any existing RRs of
the same owner and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class are authenticated by a SIG using the
same key.&nbsp; This bit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is meaningful only for type A dynamic zones
and is ignored in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type B dynamic zones.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping this bit zero on multiple KEY RRs with
the same or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nested wild card owner names permits multiple
entities to exist
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that can create and delete names but can not
effect RRs with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different owner names from any they created.&nbsp;
In effect, this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creates two levels of dynamic update key,
strong and weak, where
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak keys are limited in interfering with
each other but a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong key can interfere with any weak keys
or other strong
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keys.
<p>Bit 2, unique name update - If nonzero, this key is authorized to add
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and update RRs for only a single owner name.&nbsp;
If there already
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exist RRs with one or more names signed by
this key, they may be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; updated but no new name created until the
number of existing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names is reduced to zero.&nbsp; This bit is
meaningful only for mode
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dynamic zones and is ignored in mode B dynamic
zones. This bit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is meaningful only if the owner name is a
wildcard.&nbsp; (Any
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dynamic update KEY with a non-wildcard name
is, in effect, a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unique name update key.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bit can be used to restrict a KEY from
flooding a zone with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new names.&nbsp; In conjunction with a local
administratively imposed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limit on the number of dynamic RRs with a
particular name, it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can completely restrict a KEY from flooding
a zone with RRs.
<p>Bit 3, general update - The general update signatory field bit has no
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special meaning.&nbsp; If the other three
bits are all zero, it must
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be one so that the field is non-zero to designate
that the key
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is an update key.&nbsp; The meaning of all
values of the signatory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; field with the general bit and one or more
other signatory field
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bits on is reserved.
<p>All the signatory bit update authorizations described above only apply
if the update is within the name and class scope as per sections <a href="#3.1.1">3.1.1</a>
and <a href="#3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.2"></a>3.2 Zone Keys and Update Modes</h3>
Zone type keys are automatically authorized to sign anything in their zone,
of course, regardless of the value of their signatory field. For zone keys,
the signatory field bits have different means than they they do for update
keys, as shown below.&nbsp; The signatory field MUST be zero if dynamic
update is not supported for a zone and MUST be non-zero if it is.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+</tt>
<p>Bit 0, mode - This bit indicates the update mode for this zone.&nbsp;
Zero
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicates mode A while a one indicates mode
B.
<p>Bit 1, strong update - If nonzero, this indicates that the "strong"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key feature described in section 3.1.3 above
is implemented and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enabled for this secure zone.&nbsp; If zero,
the feature is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available.&nbsp; Has no effect if the zone
is a mode B secure update
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zone.
<p>Bit 2, unique name update - If nonzero, this indicates that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "unique name" feature described in section
3.1.3 above is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented and enabled for this secure zone.&nbsp;
If zero, this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feature is not available.&nbsp; Has no effect
if the zone is a mode B
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secure update zone.
<p>Bit 3, general - This bit has no special meeting.&nbsp; If dynamic update
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a zone is supported and the other bits
in the zone key
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signatory field are zero, it must be a one.&nbsp;
The meaning of zone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keys where the signatory field has the general
bit and one or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more other bits on is reserved.
<p>If there are multiple dynamic update KEY RRs for a zone and zone policy
is in transition, they might have different non-zero signatory fields.&nbsp;
In that case, strong and unique name restrictions must be enforced as long
as there is a non-expired zone key being advertised that indicates mode
A with the strong or unique name bit on
<br>respectively.&nbsp; Mode B updates MUST be supported as long as there
is a non-expired zone key that indicates mode B.&nbsp; Mode A updates may
be treated as mode B updates at server option if non-expired zone keys
indicate that both are supported.
<p>A server that will be executing update operations on a zone, that is,
the primary master server, MUST not advertize a zone key that will attract
requests for a mode or features that it can not support.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.3"></a>3.3 Wildcard Key Punch Through</h3>
Just as a zone key is valid throughout the entire zone, update keys with
wildcard names are valid throughout their extended scope, within the zone.
That is, they remain valid for any name that would match them, even existing
specific names within their apparent scope.
<p>If this were not so, then whenever a name within a wildcard scope was
created by dynamic update, it would be necessary to first create a copy
of the KEY RR with this name, because otherwise the existence of the more
specific name would hide the authorizing KEY RR and would make later updates
impossible.&nbsp; An updater could create such a KEY RR but could not zone
sign it with their authorizing signer.&nbsp; They would have to sign it
with the same key using the wildcard name as signer.
<br>Thus in creating, for example, one hundred type A RRs authorized by
a *.1.1.1.in-addr.arpa. KEY RR, without key punch through 100 As, 100 KEYs,
and 200 SIGs would have to be created as opposed to merely 100 As and 100
SIGs with key punch through.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Update Signatures</h2>

<p><br>Two kinds of signatures can appear in updates.&nbsp; Request signatures,
which are always required, cover the entire request and authenticate the
DNS header, including opcode, counts, etc., as well as the data. Data signatures,
on the other hand, appear only among the RRs to be added and are only required
for mode A operation.&nbsp; These two types of signatures are described
further below.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.1"></a>4.1 Update Request Signatures</h3>
An update can effect multiple owner names in a zone.&nbsp; It may be that
these different names are covered by different dynamic update keys. For
every owner name effected, the updater must know a private key valid for
that name (and the zone's class) and must prove this by appending request
SIG RRs under each such key.
<p>As specified in <a href="rfc2065.html">RFC 2065</a>, a request signature
is a SIG RR occurring at the end of a request with a type covered field
of zero.&nbsp; For an update, request signatures occur in the Additional
information section.&nbsp; Each request SIG signs the entire request, including
DNS header, but excluding any other request SIG(s) and with the ARCOUNT
in the DNS header set to what it wold be without the request SIGs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.2"></a>4.2 Update Data Signatures</h3>
Mode A dynamic secure zones require that the update requester provide SIG
RRs that will authenticate the after update state of all RR sets that are
changed by the update and are non-empty after the update. These SIG RRs
appear in the request as RRs to be added and the request must delete any
previous data SIG RRs that are invalidated by the request.
<p>In Mode B dynamic secure zones, all zone data is authenticated by zone
key SIG RRs.&nbsp; In this case, data signatures need not be included with
the update.&nbsp; A resolver can determine which mode an updatable secure
zone is using by examining the signatory field bits of the zone KEY RR
(see section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>).
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Security Considerations</h2>
Any zone permitting dynamic updates is inherently less secure than a static
secure zone maintained off line as recommended in <a href="rfc2065.html">RFC
2065</a>. If nothing else, secure dynamic update requires on line change
to and re-signing of the zone SOA resource record (RR) to increase the
SOA serial number.&nbsp; This means that compromise of the primary server
host could lead to arbitrary serial number changes.
<p>Isolation of dynamic RRs to separate zones from those holding most static
RRs can limit the damage that could occur from breach of a dynamic zone's
security.
