Abstract</h2>
This memo defines serial number arithmetic, as used in the Domain Name
System.&nbsp; The DNS has long relied upon serial number arithmetic, a
concept which has never really been defined, certainly not in an IETF document,
though which has been widely understood.&nbsp; This memo supplies the missing
definition.&nbsp; It is intended to update <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a>
and <a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC1035</a>.

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a> uses the same
terminology when defining secondary server zone consistency procedures.
<p>Unfortunately the term "sequence space arithmetic" is not defined in
either <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a> or <a href="rfc1035/">RFC1035</a>,
nor do any of their references provide further information.
<p>This phrase seems to have been intending to specify arithmetic as used
in TCP sequence numbers [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc793.txt">RFC793</a>],
and defined in [IEN-74].
<p>Unfortunately, the arithmetic defined in [IEN-74] is not adequate for
the purposes of the DNS, as no general comparison operator is defined.
<p>To avoid further problems with this simple field, this document defines
the field and the operations available upon it.&nbsp; This definition is
intended merely to clarify the intent of <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a>
and <a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC1035</a>, and is believed to generally
agree with current implementations.&nbsp; However, older, superseded, implementations
are known to have treated the serial number as a simple unsigned integer,
with no attempt to implement any kind of "sequence space arithmetic", however
that may have been interpreted, and further, ignoring the requirement that
the value wraps.&nbsp; Nothing can be done with these implementations,
beyond extermination.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. Serial Number Arithmetic</h2>
Serial numbers are formed from non-negative integers from a finite subset
of the range of all integer values.&nbsp; The lowest integer in every subset
used for this purpose is zero, the maximum is always one less than a power
of two.
<p>When considered as serial numbers however no value has any particular
significance, there is no minimum or maximum serial number, every value
has a successor and predecessor.
<p>To define a serial number to be used in this way, the size of the serial
number space must be given.&nbsp; This value, called "SERIAL_BITS", gives
the power of two which results in one larger than the largest integer corresponding
to a serial number value.&nbsp; This also specifies the number of bits
required to hold every possible value of a serial number of the defined
type.&nbsp; The operations permitted upon serial numbers are defined in
the following section.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. Operations upon the serial number</h2>
Only two operations are defined upon serial numbers, addition of a positive
integer of limited range, and comparison with another serial number.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.1"></a>3.1. Addition</h3>
Serial numbers may be incremented by the addition of a positive integer
n, where n is taken from the range of integers
<br>[0 .. (2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1)].&nbsp; For a sequence number s, the
result of such an addition, s', is defined as
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
s' = (s + n) modulo (2 ^ SERIAL_BITS)
<p>where the addition and modulus operations here act upon values that
are non-negative values of unbounded size in the usual ways of integer
arithmetic.
<p>Addition of a value outside the range
<br>[0 .. (2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1)] is undefined.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.2"></a>3.2. Comparison</h3>
Any two serial numbers, s1 and s2, may be compared.&nbsp; The definition
of the result of this comparison is as follows.
<p>For the purposes of this definition, consider two integers, i1 and i2,
from the unbounded set of non-negative integers, such that i1 and s1 have
the same numeric value, as do i2 and s2.&nbsp; Arithmetic and comparisons
applied to i1 and i2 use ordinary unbounded integer arithmetic.
<p>Then, s1 is said to be equal to s2 if and only if i1 is equal to i2,
in all other cases, s1 is not equal to s2.
<p>s1 is said to be less than s2 if, and only if, s1 is not equal to s2,
and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i1 &lt; i2 and i2 - i1 &lt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS
- 1)) or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i1 > i2 and i1 - i2 > 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1))
<p>s1 is said to be greater than s2 if, and only if, s1 is not equal to
s2, and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i1 &lt; i2 and i2 - i1 > 2^(SERIAL_BITS -
1)) or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i1 > i2 and i1 - i2 &lt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS -
1))
<p>Note that there are some pairs of values s1 and s2 for which s1 is not
equal to s2, but for which s1 is neither greater than, nor less than, s2.&nbsp;
An attempt to use these ordering operators on such pairs of values produces
an undefined result.
<p>The reason for this is that those pairs of values are such that any
simple definition that were to define s1 to be less than s2 where (s1,
s2) is such a pair, would also usually cause s2 to be less than s1, when
the pair is (s2, s1).&nbsp; This would mean that the particular order selected
for a test could cause the result to differ, leading to unpredictable implementations.
<p>While it would be possible to define the test in such a way that the
inequality would not have this surprising property, while being defined
for all pairs of values, such a definition would be unnecessarily burdensome
to implement, and difficult to understand, and would still allow cases
where
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s1 &lt; s2 and (s1 + 1) > (s2 + 1)
<p>which is just as non-intuitive.
<p>Thus the problem case is left undefined, implementations are free to
return either result, or to flag an error, and users must take care not
to depend on any particular outcome.&nbsp; Usually this will mean avoiding
allowing those particular pairs of numbers to co-exist.
<p>The relationships greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to,
follow in the natural way from the above definitions.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Corollaries</h2>
These definitions give rise to some results of note.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.1"></a>4.1. Corollary 1</h3>
For any sequence number s and any integer n such that addition of n to
s is well defined, (s + n) >= s.&nbsp; Further (s + n) == s only when n
== 0, in all other defined cases, (s + n) > s.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.2"></a>4.2. Corollary 2</h3>
If s' is the result of adding the non-zero integer n to the sequence number
s, and m is another integer from the range defined as able to be added
to a sequence number, and s" is the result of adding m to s', then it is
undefined whether s" is greater than, or less than s, though it is known
that s" is not equal to s.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.3"></a>4.3. Corollary 3</h3>
If s" from the previous corollary is further incremented, then there is
no longer any known relationship between the result and s.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="4.4"></a>4.4. Corollary 4</h3>
If in corollary 2 the value (n + m) is such that addition of the sum to
sequence number s would produce a defined result, then corollary 1 applies,
and s" is known to be greater than s.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. Examples</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="5.1"></a>5.1. A trivial example</h3>
The simplest meaningful serial number space has SERIAL_BITS == 2.&nbsp;
In this space, the integers that make up the serial number space are 0,
1, 2, and 3.&nbsp; That is, 3 == 2^SERIAL_BITS - 1.
<p>In this space, the largest integer that it is meaningful to add to a
sequence number is 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1, or 1.
<p>Then, as defined 0+1 == 1, 1+1 == 2, 2+1 == 3, and 3+1 == 0. Further,
1 > 0, 2 > 1, 3 > 2, and 0 > 3.&nbsp; It is undefined whether 2 > 0 or
0 > 2, and whether 1 > 3 or 3 > 1.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="5.2"></a>5.2. A slightly larger example</h3>
Consider the case where SERIAL_BITS == 8.&nbsp; In this space the integers
that make up the serial number space are 0, 1, 2, ... 254, 255. 255 ==
2^SERIAL_BITS - 1.
<p>In this space, the largest integer that it is meaningful to add to a
sequence number is 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1, or 127.
<p>Addition is as expected in this space, for example: 255+1 == 0, 100+100
== 200, and 200+100 == 44.
<p>Comparison is more interesting, 1 > 0, 44 > 0, 100 > 0, 100 > 44, 200
> 100, 255 > 200, 0 > 255, 100 > 255, 0 > 200, and 44 > 200.
<p>Note that 100+100 > 100, but that (100+100)+100 &lt; 100.&nbsp; Incrementing
a serial number can cause it to become "smaller".&nbsp; Of course, incrementing
by a smaller number will allow many more increments to be made before this
occurs.&nbsp; However this is always something to be aware of, it can cause
surprising errors, or be useful as it is the only defined way to actually
cause a serial number to decrease.
<p>The pairs of values 0 and 128, 1 and 129, 2 and 130, etc, to 127 and
255 are not equal, but in each pair, neither number is defined as being
greater than, or less than, the other.
<p>It could be defined (arbitrarily) that 128 > 0, 129 > 1, 130 > 2, ...,
255 > 127, by changing the comparison operator definitions, as mentioned
above.&nbsp; However note that that would cause 255 > 127, while (255 +
1) &lt; (127 + 1), as 0 &lt; 128.&nbsp; Such a definition, apart from being
arbitrary, would also be more costly to implement.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="6"></a>6. Citation</h2>
As this defined arithmetic may be useful for purposes other than for the
DNS serial number, it may be referenced as Serial Number Arithmetic from
RFC1982.&nbsp; Any such reference shall be taken as implying that the rules
of sections 2 to 5 of this document apply to the stated values.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="7"></a>7. The DNS SOA serial number</h2>
The serial number in the DNS SOA Resource Record is a Serial Number as
defined above, with SERIAL_BITS being 32.&nbsp; That is, the serial number
is a non negative integer with values taken from the range [0 .. 4294967295].&nbsp;
That is, a 32 bit unsigned integer.
<p>The maximum defined increment is 2147483647 (2^31 - 1).
<p>Care should be taken that the serial number not be incremented, in one
or more steps, by more than this maximum within the period given by the
value of SOA.expire.&nbsp; Doing so may leave some secondary servers with
out of date copies of the zone, but with a serial number "greater" than
that of the primary server.&nbsp; Of course, special circumstances may
require this rule be set aside, for example, when the serial number needs
to be set lower for some reason.&nbsp; If this must be done, then take
special care to verify that ALL servers have correctly succeeded in following
the primary server's serial number changes, at each step.
<p>Note that each, and every, increment to the serial number must be treated
as the start of a new sequence of increments for this purpose, as well
as being the continuation of all previous sequences started within the
period specified by SOA.expire.
<p>Caution should also be exercised before causing the serial number to
be set to the value zero.&nbsp; While this value is not in any way special
in serial number arithmetic, or to the DNS SOA serial number, many DNS
implementations have incorrectly treated zero as a special case, with special
properties, and unusual behaviour may be expected if zero is used as a
DNS SOA serial number.

<h2>
<a NAME="8"></a>8. Document Updates</h2>
<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC1034</a> and <a href="rfc1035/">RFC1035</a>
are to be treated as if the references to "sequence space arithmetic" therein
are replaced by references to serial number arithmetic, as defined in this
document.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="9"></a>9. Security Considerations</h2>
This document does not consider security.
<p>It is not believed that anything in this document adds to any security
issues that may exist with the DNS, nor does it do anything to lessen them.
