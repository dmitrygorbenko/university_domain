<A NAME="Abstract"></A>1. Abstract</H2>
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) uses X.500-compatible
distinguished names [3] for providing unique identification of entries.

<P>This document defines an algorithm by which a name registered with the
Internet Domain Name Service [2] can be represented as an LDAP distinguished
name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="Background"></A>2. Background</H2>
The Domain (Nameserver) System (DNS) provides a hierarchical resource labeling
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; A name is made up of an ordered set of components,
each of which are short strings. An example domain name with two components
would be "CRITICAL-ANGLE.COM".

<P>LDAP-based directories provide a more general hierarchical naming framework.
A primary difference in specification of distinguished names from domain
names is that each component of an distinguished name has an explicit attribute
type indication.

<P>X.500 does not mandate any particular naming structure.&nbsp; It does
contain suggested naming structures which are based on geographic and national
regions, however there is not currently an established registration infrastructure
in many regions which would be able to assign or ensure uniqueness of names.

<P>The mechanism described in this document automatically provides an enterprise
a distinguished name for each domain name it has obtained for use in the
Internet.&nbsp; These distinguished names may be used to identify objects
in an LDAP directory.

<P>An example distinguished name represented in the LDAP string format
[3] is "DC=CRITICAL-ANGLE,DC=COM".&nbsp; As with a domain name, the most
significant component, closest to the root of the namespace, is written
last.

<P>This document does not define how to represent objects which do not
have domain names.&nbsp; Nor does this document define the procedure to
locate an enterprise's LDAP directory server, given their domain name.&nbsp;
Such procedures may be defined in future RFCs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="Mapping"></A>3. Mapping Domain Names into Distinguished Names</H2>
This section defines a subset of the possible distinguished name structures
for use in representing names allocated in the Internet Domain Name System.&nbsp;
It is possible to algorithmically transform any Internet domain name into
a distinguished name, and to convert these distinguished names back into
the original domain names.

<P>The algorithm for transforming a domain name is to begin with an empty
distinguished name (DN) and then attach Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs)
for each component of the domain, most significant (e.g. rightmost) first.
Each of these RDNs is a single AttributeTypeAndValue, where the type is
the attribute "DC" and the value is an IA5 string containing the domain
name component.

<P>Thus the domain name "CS.UCL.AC.UK" can be transformed into

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC=CS,DC=UCL,DC=AC,DC=UK
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Distinguished names in which there are one or more RDNs, all containing
only the attribute type DC, can be mapped back into domain names. Note
that this document does not define a domain name equivalence for any other
distinguished names.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="Attribute Type"></A>4. Attribute Type Definition</H2>
The DC (short for domainComponent) attribute type is defined as follows:

<P>( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25 NAME 'dc' EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
<BR>&nbsp;SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
<BR>&nbsp;SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 SINGLE-VALUE )

<P>The value of this attribute is a string holding one component of a domain
name.&nbsp; The encoding of IA5String for use in LDAP is simply the characters
of the string itself.&nbsp; The equality matching rule is case insensitive,
as is today's DNS.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="Object Class"></A>5. Object Class Definitions</H2>
An object with a name derived from its domain name using the algorithm
of section 3 is represented as an entry in the directory. The "DC" attribute
is present in the entry and used as the RDN.

<P>An attribute can only be present in an entry held by an LDAP server
when that attribute is permitted by the entry's object class.

<P>This section defines two object classes.&nbsp; The first, dcObject,
is intended to be used in entries for which there is an appropriate structural
object class.&nbsp; For example, if the domain represents a particular
organization, the entry would have as its structural object class 'organization',
and the 'dcObject' class would be an auxiliary class.&nbsp; The second,
domain, is a structural object class used for entries in which no other
information is being stored. The domain object class is typically used
for entries that are placeholders or whose domains do not correspond to
real-world entities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="dcObject"></A>5.1. The dcObject object class</H3>
The dcObject object class permits the dc attribute to be present in an
entry.&nbsp; This object class is defined as auxiliary, as it would typically
be used in conjunction with an existing structural object class, such as
organization, organizationalUnit or locality.

<P>The following object class, along with the dc attribute, can be added
to any entry.

<P>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.344 NAME 'dcObject' SUP top AUXILIARY MUST dc )

<P>An example entry would be:

<P>dn: dc=critical-angle,dc=com
<BR>objectClass: top
<BR>objectClass: organization
<BR>objectClass: dcObject
<BR>dc: critical-angle
<BR>o: Critical Angle Inc.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="domain object"></A>5.2. The domain object class</H3>
If the entry does not correspond to an organization, organizational unit
or other type of object for which an object class has been defined, then
the "domain" object class can be used.&nbsp; The "domain" object class
requires that the "DC" attribute be present, and permits several other
attributes to be present in the entry.

<P>The entry will have as its structural object class the "domain" object
class.

<P>( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.4.13 NAME 'domain' SUP top STRUCTURAL
<BR>MUST dc
<BR>MAY ( userPassword $ searchGuide $ seeAlso $ businessCategory $
<BR>x121Address $ registeredAddress $ destinationIndicator $
<BR>preferredDeliveryMethod $ telexNumber $ teletexTerminalIdentifier $
<BR>telephoneNumber $ internationaliSDNNumber $ facsimileTelephoneNumber
$
<BR>street $ postOfficeBox $ postalCode $ postalAddress $
<BR>physicalDeliveryOfficeName $ st $ l $ description $ o $
<BR>associatedName ) )

<P>The optional attributes of the domain class are used for describing
the object represented by this domain, and may also be useful when searching.&nbsp;
These attributes are already defined for use with LDAP [4].

<P>An example entry would be:

<P>dn: dc=tcp,dc=critical-angle,dc=com
<BR>objectClass: top
<BR>objectClass: domain
<BR>dc: tcp
<BR>description: a placeholder entry used with SRV records

<P>The DC attribute is used for naming entries of the domain class, and
this can be represented in X.500 servers by the following name form rule.

<P>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.345 NAME 'domainNameForm' OC domain MUST ( dc ) )

<A NAME="Security"></A>7. Security Considerations</H2>
This memo describes how attributes of objects may be discovered and retrieved.&nbsp;
Servers should ensure that an appropriate security policy is maintained.

<P>An enterprise is not restricted in the information which it may store
in DNS or LDAP servers.&nbsp; A client which contacts an untrusted server
may have incorrect or misleading information returned (e.g. an organization's
server may claim to hold naming contexts representing domain names which
have not been delegated to that organization).
