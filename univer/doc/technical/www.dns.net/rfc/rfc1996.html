A Mechanism for Prompt Notification of Zone Changes (DNS NOTIFY)</h1></center>

<h2>
Status of this Memo</h2>
This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the Internet
community, and requests discussion and&nbsp; suggestions for improvements.&nbsp;
Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol
Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol.&nbsp;
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<h2>
Abstract</h2>
This memo describes the NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which a master server
advises a set of slave servers that the master's data has been changed
and that a query should be initiated to discover the new data.

<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Rationale and Scope</h2>
1.1. Slow propagation of new and changed data in a DNS zone can be due
to a zone's relatively long refresh times.&nbsp; Longer refresh times are
beneficial in that they reduce load on the master servers, but that benefit
comes at the cost of long intervals of incoherence among authority servers
whenever the zone is updated.
<p>1.2. The DNS NOTIFY transaction allows master servers to inform slave
servers when the zone has changed -- an interrupt as opposed to poll model
-- which it is hoped will reduce propagation delay while not unduly increasing
the masters' load.&nbsp; This specification only allows slaves to be notified
of SOA RR changes, but the architechture of NOTIFY is intended to be&nbsp;
extensible to other RR types.
<p>1.3. This document intentionally gives more definition to the roles
of "Master," "Slave" and "Stealth" servers, their enumeration in NS RRs,
and the SOA MNAME field.&nbsp; In that sense, this document can be considered
an addendum to [<a href="rfc1035/rfc1035.html">RFC1035</a>].
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. Definitions and Invariants</h2>
2.1. The following definitions are used in this document:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="10%">Slave</td>

<td>an authoritative server which uses zone transfer to retrieve the zone.&nbsp;
All slave servers are named in the NS RRs for the zone.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Master</td>

<td>any authoritative server configured to be the source of zone transfer
for one or more slave servers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Primary Master</td>

<td>master server at the root of the zone transfer dependency graph.&nbsp;
The primary master is named in the zone's SOA MNAME field and optionally
by an NS RR.&nbsp; There is by definition only one primary master server
per zone.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Stealth</td>

<td>like a slave server except not listed in an NS RR for the zone.&nbsp;
A stealth server, unless explicitly configured to do otherwise, will set
the AA bit in responses and be capable of acting as a master.&nbsp; A stealth
server will only be known by other servers if they are given static configuration
data indicating its existence.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Notify Set</td>

<td>set of servers to be notified of changes to some zone.&nbsp; Default
is all servers named in the NS RRset, except for any server also named
in the SOA MNAME. Some implementations will permit the name server administrator
to override this set or add elements to it (such as, for example, stealth
servers).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>2.2. The zone's servers must be organized into a dependency graph such
that there is a primary master, and all other servers must use AXFR or
IXFR either from the primary master or from some slave which is also a
master.&nbsp; No loops are permitted in the AXFR dependency graph.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. NOTIFY Message</h2>
3.1. When a master has updated one or more RRs in which slave servers may
be interested, the master may send the changed RR's name, class, type,
and optionally, new RDATA(s), to each known slave server using a best efforts
protocol based on the NOTIFY opcode.
<p>3.2. NOTIFY uses the DNS Message Format, although it uses only a subset
of the available fields.&nbsp; Fields not otherwise described herein are
to be filled with binary zero (0), and implementations must ignore all
messages for which this is not the case.
<p>3.3. NOTIFY is similar to QUERY in that it has a request message with
the header QR flag "clear" and a response message with QR "set".&nbsp;
The response message contains no useful information, but its reception
by the master is an indication that the slave has received the NOTIFY and
that the master can remove the slave from any retry queue for this NOTIFY
event.
<p>3.4. The transport protocol used for a NOTIFY transaction will be UDP
unless the master has reason to believe that TCP is necessary; for example,
if a firewall has been installed between master and slave, and only TCP
has been allowed; or, if the changed RR is too large to fit in a UDP/DNS
datagram.
<p>3.5. If TCP is used, both master and slave must continue to offer name
service during the transaction, even when the TCP transaction is not making
progress.&nbsp; The NOTIFY request is sent once, and a "timeout" is said
to have occurred if no NOTIFY response is received within a reasonable
interval.
<p>3.6. If UDP is used, a master periodically sends a NOTIFY request to
a slave until either too many copies have been sent (a "timeout"), an ICMP
message indicating that the port is unreachable, or until a NOTIFY response
is received from the slave with a matching query ID, QNAME, IP source address,
and UDP source port number.
<p>Note:
<blockquote>The interval between transmissions, and the total number of
retransmissions, should be operational parameters specifiable by the name
server administrator, perhaps on a per-zone basis. Reasonable defaults
are a 60 second interval (or timeout if using TCP), and a maximum of 5
retransmissions (for UDP).&nbsp; It is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; considered reasonable
to use additive or exponential backoff for&nbsp; the retry interval.</blockquote>

<p><br>3.7. A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT>0, ANCOUNT>=0, AUCOUNT>=0, ADCOUNT>=0.&nbsp;
If ANCOUNT>0, then the answer section represents an unsecure hint at the
new RRset for this &lt;QNAME,QCLASS,QTYPE>.&nbsp; A slave receiving such
a hint is free to treat equivilence of this answer section with its local
data as a "no further work needs to be done" indication.&nbsp; If ANCOUNT=0,
or ANCOUNT>0 and the answer section differs from the slave's local data,
then the slave should query its known masters to retrieve the new data.
<p>3.8. In no case shall the answer section of a NOTIFY request be used
to update a slave's local data, or to indicate that a zone transfer needs
to be undertaken, or to change the slave's zone refresh timers.
<p>Only a "data present; data same" condition can lead a slave to act differently
if ANCOUNT>0 than it would if ANCOUNT=0.
<p>3.9. This version of the NOTIFY specification makes no use of the authority
or additional data sections, and so conforming implementations should set
AUCOUNT=0 and ADCOUNT=0 when transmitting requests.&nbsp; Since a future
revision of this specification may define a backwards compatible use for
either or both of these sections, current implementations must ignore these
sections, but not the entire message, if AUCOUNT>0 and/or ADCOUNT>0.
<p>3.10. If a slave receives a NOTIFY request from a host that is not a
known master for the zone containing the QNAME, it should ignore the request
and produce an error message in its operations log.
<p>Note:
<blockquote>This implies that slaves of a multihomed master must either
know their master by the "closest" of the master's interface addresses,
or must know all of the master's interface addresses. Otherwise, a valid
NOTIFY request might come from an address that is not on the slave's state
list of masters for the zone, which would be an error.</blockquote>

<p><br>3.11. The only defined NOTIFY event at this time is that the SOA
RR has changed.&nbsp; Upon completion of a NOTIFY transaction for QTYPE=SOA,
the slave should behave as though the zone given in the QNAME had reached
its REFRESH interval (see [RFC1035]), i.e., it should query its masters
for the SOA of the zone given in the NOTIFY QNAME, and
<br>check the answer to see if the SOA SERIAL has been incremented since
the last time the zone was fetched.&nbsp; If so, a zone transfer (either
AXFR or IXFR) should be initiated.
<p>Note:
<blockquote>Because a deep server dependency graph may have multiple paths
from the primary master to any given slave, it is possible that a slave
will receive a NOTIFY from one of its known masters even though the rest
of its known masters have not yet updated their copies of the zone.&nbsp;
Therefore, when issuing a QUERY for the zone's SOA, the query should be
directed at the known master who was the source of the NOTIFY event, and
not at any of the other known masters.&nbsp; This represents a departure
from [RFC1035], which specifies that upon expiry of the SOA REFRESH interval,
all known masters should be queried in turn.</blockquote>

<p><br>3.12. If a NOTIFY request is received by a slave who does not implement
the NOTIFY opcode, it will respond with a NOTIMP (unimplemented feature
error) message.&nbsp; A master server who receives such a NOTIMP should
consider the NOTIFY transaction complete for that slave.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Details and Examples</h2>
4.1. Retaining query state information across host reboots is optional,
but it is reasonable to simply execute an SOA NOTIFY transaction on each
authority zone when a server first starts.
<p>4.2. Each slave is likely to receive several copies of the same NOTIFY
request:&nbsp; One from the primary master, and one from each other slave
as that slave transfers the new zone and notifies its potential peers.&nbsp;
The NOTIFY protocol supports this multiplicity by requiring that NOTIFY
be sent by a slave/master only AFTER it has updated the SOA RR or has determined
that no update is necessary, which in practice means after a successful
zone transfer.&nbsp; Thus, barring delivery reordering, the last NOTIFY
any slave receives will be the one indicating the latest change.&nbsp;
Since a slave always requests SOAs and AXFR/IXFRs only from its known masters,
it will have an opportunity to retry its QUERY for the SOA after each of
its masters have completed each zone update.
<p>4.3. If a master server seeks to avoid causing a large number of simultaneous
outbound zone transfers, it may delay for an arbitrary length of time before
sending a NOTIFY message to any given slave. It is expected that the time
will be chosen at random, so that each slave will begin its transfer at
a unique time.&nbsp; The delay shall not in any case be longer than the
SOA REFRESH time.
<p>Note:
<blockquote>This delay should be a parameter that each primary master name
server can specify, perhaps on a per-zone basis.&nbsp; Random delays of
between 30 and 60 seconds would seem adequate if the servers share a LAN
and the zones are of moderate size.</blockquote>

<p><br>4.4. A slave which receives a valid NOTIFY should defer action on
any subsequent NOTIFY with the same&nbsp; &lt;QNAME,QCLASS,QTYPE> until
it has completed the transaction begun by the first NOTIFY.&nbsp; This
duplicate rejection is necessary to avoid having multiple notifications
lead to pummeling the master server.
<p>4.5 Zone has Updated on Primary Master
<p>Primary master sends a NOTIFY request to all servers named in Notify
Set.&nbsp; The NOTIFY request has the following characteristics:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; query ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; (new)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; op:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOTIFY (4)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; resp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOERROR</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; flags:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AA</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qcount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qname:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (zone name)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qclass:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (zone class)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qtype:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T_SOA</tt>
<p>4.6 Zone has Updated on a Slave that is also a Master
<p>As above in 4.5, except that this server's Notify Set may be different
from the Primary Master's due to optional static specification of local
stealth servers.
<p>4.7 Slave Receives a NOTIFY Request from a Master
<p>When a slave server receives a NOTIFY request from one of its locally
designated masters for the zone enclosing the given QNAME, with QTYPE=SOA
and QR=0, it should enter the state it would if the zone's refresh timer
had expired.&nbsp; It will also send a NOTIFY response back to the NOTIFY
request's source, with the following characteristics:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; query ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; (same)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; op:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOTIFY (4)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; resp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOERROR</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; flags:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QR AA</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qcount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qname:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (zone name)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qclass:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (zone class)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; qtype:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T_SOA</tt>
<p>This is intended to be identical to the NOTIFY request, except that
the QR bit is also set.&nbsp; The query ID of the response must be the
same as was received in the request.
<p>4.8 Master Receives a NOTIFY Response from Slave
<p>When a master server receives a NOTIFY response, it deletes this query
from the retry queue, thus completing the "notification
<br>process" of "this" RRset change to "that" server.
