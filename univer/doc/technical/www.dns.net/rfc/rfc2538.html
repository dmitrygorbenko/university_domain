<h2>
<a NAME="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
Public keys are frequently published in the form of a certificate and their
authenticity is commonly demonstrated by certificates and related certificate
revocation lists (CRLs).&nbsp; A certificate is a binding, through a cryptographic
digital signature, of a public key, a validity interval and/or conditions,
and identity, authorization, or other information. A certificate revocation
list is a list of certificates that are revoked, and incidental information,
all signed by the signer (issuer) of the revoked certificates. Examples
are X.509 certificates/CRLs in the X.500 directory system or PGP certificates/revocations
used by PGP software.
<p><a href="#2">Section 2</a> below specifies a CERT resource record (RR)
for the storage of certificates in the Domain Name System.
<p><a href="#3">Section 3</a> discusses appropriate owner names for CERT
RRs.
<p>Sections <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, and <a href="#6">6</a>
below cover performance, IANA, and security considerations, respectively.
<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>].

<h2>
<a NAME="2"></a>2. The CERT Resource Record</h2>
The CERT resource record (RR) has the structure given below.&nbsp; Its
RR type code is 37.

<p>The type field is the certificate type as define in <a href="#2.1">section
2.1</a> below.
<p>The algorithm field has the same meaning as the algorithm field in KEY
and SIG RRs [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>] except that a zero algorithm
field indicates the algorithm is unknown to a secure DNS, which may simply
be the result of the algorithm not having been standardized for secure
DNS.
<p>The key tag field is the 16 bit value computed for the key embedded
in the certificate as specified in the DNSSEC Standard [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC
2535</a>]. This field is used as an efficiency measure to pick which CERT
RRs may be applicable to a particular key.&nbsp; The key tag can be calculated
for the key in question and then only CERT RRs with the same key tag need
be examined. However, the key must always be transformed to the format
it would have as the public key portion of a KEY RR before the key tag
is computed.&nbsp; This is only possible if the key is applicable to an
algorithm (and limits such as key size limits) defined for DNS security.&nbsp;
If it is not, the algorithm field MUST BE zero and the tag field is meaningless
and SHOULD BE zero.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.1"></a>2.1 Certificate Type Values</h3>
The following values are defined or reserved:
<p><tt>&nbsp;Value&nbsp; Mnemonic&nbsp; Certificate Type</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;-----&nbsp; --------&nbsp; ----------- ----</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reserved</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; PKIX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
X.509 as per PKIX</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; SPKI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SPKI cert</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; PGP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PGP cert</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;4-252&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
available for IANA assignment</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 253&nbsp;&nbsp; URI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
URI private</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 254&nbsp;&nbsp; OID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OID private</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;255-65534&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available
for IANA assignment</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;65535&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reserved</tt>
<p>The PKIX type is reserved to indicate an X.509 certificate conforming
to the profile being defined by the IETF PKIX working group.&nbsp; The
certificate section will start with a one byte unsigned OID length and
then an X.500 OID indicating the nature of the remainder of the certificate
section (see <a href="#2.3">2.3</a> below).&nbsp; (NOTE: X.509 certificates
do not include their X.500 directory type designating OID as a prefix.)
<p>The SPKI type is reserved to indicate a certificate formated as to be
specified by the IETF SPKI working group.
<p>The PGP type indicates a Pretty Good Privacy certificate as described
in <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2440.txt">RFC 2440</a> and its extensions
and successors.
<p>The URI private type indicates a certificate format defined by an absolute
URI.&nbsp; The certificate portion of the CERT RR MUST begin with a null
terminated URI [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</a>]
and the data after the null is the private format certificate itself.&nbsp;
The URI SHOULD be such that a retrieval from it will lead to documentation
on the format of the certificate.&nbsp; Recognition of private certificate
types need not be based on URI equality but can use various forms of pattern
matching so that, for example, subtype or version information can also
be encoded into the URI.
<p>The OID private type indicates a private format certificate specified
by a an ISO OID prefix.&nbsp; The certificate section will start with a
one byte unsigned OID length and then a BER encoded OID indicating the
nature of the remainder of the certificate section.&nbsp; This can be an
X.509 certificate format or some other format.&nbsp; X.509 certificates
that conform to the IETF PKIX profile SHOULD be indicated by the PKIX type,
not the OID private type.&nbsp; Recognition of private certificate
<br>types need not be based on OID equality but can use various forms of
pattern matching such as OID prefix.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.2"></a>2.2 Text Representation of CERT RRs</h3>

<p><br>The RDATA portion of a CERT RR has the type field as an unsigned
integer or as a mnemonic symbol as listed in <a href="#2.1">section 2.1</a>
above.
<p>The key tag field is represented as an unsigned integer.
<p>The algorithm field is represented as an unsigned integer or a mnemonic
symbol as listed in [<a href="rfc2535.html">RFC 2535</a>].
<p>The certificate / CRL portion is represented in base 64 and may be divided
up into any number of white space separated substrings, down to single
base 64 digits, which are concatenated to obtain the full signature.&nbsp;
These substrings can span lines using the standard parenthesis.
<p>Note that the certificate / CRL portion may have internal sub-fields
but these do not appear in the master file representation.&nbsp; For example,
with type 254, there will be an OID size, an OID, and then the certificate
/ CRL proper. But only a single logical base 64 string will appear in the
text representation.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="2.3"></a>2.3 X.509 OIDs</h3>
OIDs have been defined in connection with the X.500 directory for user
certificates, certification authority certificates, revocations of certification
authority, and revocations of user certificates. The following table lists
the OIDs, their BER encoding, and their length prefixed hex format for
use in CERT RRs:
<p><tt>&nbsp;id-at-userCertificate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) at(4) 36
}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == 0x 03 55 04 24</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;id-at-cACertificate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) at(4) 37
}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == 0x 03 55 04 25</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;id-at-authorityRevocationList</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) at(4) 38
}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == 0x 03 55 04 26</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;id-at-certificateRevocationList</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) at(4) 39
}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == 0x 03 55 04 27</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="3"></a>3. Appropriate Owner Names for CERT RRs</h2>
It is recommended that certificate CERT RRs be stored under a domain name
related to their subject, i.e., the name of the entity intended to control
the private key corresponding to the public key being certified.&nbsp;
It is recommended that certificate revocation list CERT RRs be stored under
a domain name related to their issuer.
<p>Following some of the guidelines below may result in the use in DNS
names of characters that require DNS quoting which is to use a backslash
followed by the octal representation of the ASCII code for the character
such as \000 for NULL.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.1"></a>3.1 X.509 CERT RR Names</h3>
Some X.509 versions permit multiple names to be associated with subjects
and issuers under "Subject Alternate Name" and "Issuer Alternate Name".&nbsp;
For example, x.509v3 has such Alternate Names with an ASN.1 specification
as follows:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GeneralName ::= CHOICE {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[0] INSTANCE OF OTHER-NAME,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rfc822Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[1] IA5String,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dNSName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[2] IA5String,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x400Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[3] EXPLICIT OR-ADDRESS.&amp;Type,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directoryName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[4] EXPLICIT Name,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ediPartyName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[5] EDIPartyName,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uniformResourceIdentifier&nbsp;
[6] IA5String,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iPAddress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[7] OCTET STRING,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; registeredID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<p>The recommended locations of CERT storage are as follows, in priority
order:
<p>(1) If a domain name is included in the identification in the certificate
or CRL, that should be used.
<br>(2) If a domain name is not included but an IP address is included,
then the translation of that IP address into the appropriate&nbsp; inverse
domain name should be used.
<br>(3) If neither of the above it used but a URI containing a domain&nbsp;
name is present, that domain name should be used.
<br>(4) If none of the above is included but a character string name is
included, then it should be treated as described for PGP names in <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>
below.
<br>(5) If none of the above apply, then the distinguished name (DN) should
be mapped into a domain name as specified in <a href="rfc2247.html">RFC
2247</a>.
<p>Example 1: Assume that an X.509v3 certificate is issued to /CN=John
Doe/DC=Doe/DC=com/DC=xy/O=Doe Inc/C=XY/ with Subject Alternative names
of (a) string "John (the Man) Doe", (b) domain name john-doe.com, and (c)
uri &lt;https://www.secure.john-doe.com:8080/>.&nbsp; Then the storage
locations recommended, in priority order, would be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) john-doe.com,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) www.secure.john-doe.com, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Doe.com.xy.
<p>Example 2:&nbsp; Assume that an X.509v3 certificate is issued to /CN=James
Hacker/L=Basingstoke/O=Widget Inc/C=GB/ with Subject Alternate names of
(a) domain name widget.foo.example, (b) IPv4 address 10.251.13.201, and
(c) string "James Hacker &lt;hacker@mail.widget.foo.example>".&nbsp; Then
the storage locations recommended, in priority order, would be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) widget.foo.example,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) 201.13.251.10.in-addr.arpa, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) hacker.mail.widget.foo.example.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="3.2"></a>3.2 PGP CERT RR Names</h3>
PGP signed keys (certificates) use a general character string User ID [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2440.txt">RFC
2440</a>]. However, it is recommended by PGP that such names include the
<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</a> email address of the party, as in "Leslie Example &lt;Leslie@host.example>".&nbsp;
If such a format is used, the CERT should be under the standard translation
of the email address into a domain name, which would be leslie.host.example
in this case.&nbsp; If no <a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC
822 </a>name can be extracted from the string name no specific domain name
is recommended.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="4"></a>4. Performance Considerations</h2>
Current Domain Name System (DNS) implementations are optimized for small
transfers, typically not more than 512 bytes including overhead.&nbsp;
While larger transfers will perform correctly and work is underway to make
larger transfers more efficient, it is still advisable at this time to
make every reasonable effort to minimize the size of certificates stored
within the DNS.&nbsp; Steps that can be taken may include using the fewest
possible optional or extensions fields and using short field values for
variable length fields that must be included.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="5"></a>5. IANA Considerations</h2>
Certificate types 0x0000 through 0x00FF and 0xFF00 through 0xFFFF can only
be assigned by an IETF standards action [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2434.txt">RFC
2434</a>] (and this document assigns 0x0001 through 0x0003 and 0x00FD and
0x00FE). Certificate types 0x0100 through 0xFEFF are assigned through IETF
Consensus [<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc2434.txt">RFC 2434</a>] based
on RFC documentation of the certificate type.&nbsp; The availability of
private types under 0x00FD and 0x00FE should satisfy most requirements
for proprietary or private types.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="6"></a>6. Security Considerations</h2>
By definition, certificates contain their own authenticating signature.&nbsp;
Thus it is reasonable to store certificates in non-secure DNS zones or
to retrieve certificates from DNS with DNS security checking not implemented
or deferred for efficiency.&nbsp; The results MAY be trusted if the certificate
chain is verified back to a known trusted key and this conforms with the
user's security policy.
<p>Alternatively, if certificates are retrieved from a secure DNS zone
with DNS security checking enabled and are verified by DNS security, the
key within the retrieved certificate MAY be trusted without verifying the
certificate chain if this conforms with the user's security policy.
<p>CERT RRs are not used in connection with securing the DNS security additions
so there are no security considerations related to CERT RRs and securing
the DNS itself.
